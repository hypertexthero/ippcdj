The IAEA, through its Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, has been actively supporting the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) during the last 7 years to review and develop International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs) and in creating phytosanitary capacity in IPPC Contracting Parties in order to level the playing field in international agricultural trade.</p>\r\n<p>2. In terms of normative activities, the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has participated in the development of the following adopted ISPMs Nos. 3, 18, 26 and 30. In addition we have also contributed to the development of the draft ISPM on Systems Approaches for Pest Risk Management of Fruit Flies, a draft appendix to ISPM No. 26 on Fruit Fly Trapping, the draft ISPM on Phytosanitary Procedures for Fruit Fly (Tephritidae) Management, and the draft ISPM on Protocol to Determine Host Status for Fruits and Vegetables to Fruit Fly (Tephritidae) Infestation.</p>\r\n<p>3. Our Joint Division has also organized and funded the last four annual meetings of the IPPC Technical Panel on Pest Free Areas and Systems Approaches for Fruit Flies that we hosted in Vienna and we are now in the process of organizing the next meeting, which due to our financial support is the only IPPC technical panel that will meet in 2011,&nbsp; The meeting will be held in Recife, Brazil in August 2011, and will focus on developing of a the draft annex to the ISPM 26 on Establishment and maintenance of fruit fly regulated areas in the event of outbreak detection in Pest Free Areas for fruit flies.</p>\r\n<p>4. In support of the IPPC Technical Panel on Phytosanitary Treatments, the Joint FAO/IAEA Division provided technical expertise and supporting data which helped facilitate the successful adoption of eleven post-harvest phytosanitary irradiation treatments for pests of quarantine importance. These treatments were adopted by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures for inclusion in ISPM No. 28 on Phytosanitary Treatments for Regulated Pests.&nbsp; It is hoped that three more of these types of treatments will be adopted at CPM-6 (see CPM2011/04).</p>\r\n<p>5. The Joint FAO/IAEA Division is continuing its Coordinated Research Project on the Development of Generic Irradiation Doses for Quarantine Treatments; the second Research Coordination Meeting under the project will be held at Texas A&amp;M University from 11-15 April 2011. It is hoped that this research network will determine generic and specific doses for pests and pest groups of quarantine importance (29 insect species from 13 arthropod families). Based on this research, submissions in response to the IPPC&rsquo;s call for phytosanitary treatments may be made. Once adopted, these phytosanitary treatments may help facilitate trade by reducing technical barriers to the international trade in agricultural produce.</p>\r\n<p>6. The Joint Division is also currently developing Guidelines for the Audit and Accreditation of&nbsp; Irradiation Facilities used for Sanitary and Phytosanitary Treatment of Food and Agricultural Products, and has held three FAO/IAEA Regional Meetings in 2010 on the development and review of the Guidelines in Austria, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; The Guidelines will provide a common framework for the audit and accreditation of irradiation facilities used for sanitary and phytosanitary purposes to ensure proper dosing and safeguarding of food articles traded by APPPC Member Countries, and will be used to assess the effectiveness and ability of a facility to fulfil requirements for the irradiation of food and agricultural products.<br />&nbsp;<br />7. In terms of capacity building, the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has devoted part of its technical assistance delivery to the implementation of the ISPMs in developing countries through national or regional workshops and technical meetings. During 2009 and 2010, three FAO/IAEA Regional Training Courses on &ldquo;Area-wide Integrated Pest Management of Tephritid Fruit Flies&rdquo;, &ldquo;Surveillance of Tephritid Fruit Flies in Support of Planning and Implementing Area-wide Integrated Pest Management Programmes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taxonomy, Ecology and Control of Fruit Flies of Quarantine Importance&rdquo; were held in respectively China, Thailand and Panama. These courses were attended by 93 participants from 30 countries of the Latin America, and Asia and Pacific regions. Additionally, the FAO/IAEA Division has funded each year fellows for two other fruit fly training courses in Latin America (Mexico and Brazil) and lecturers on the regulatory aspects of fruit commercialization.</p><link http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/ipc/index.html  - external-link-new-window \"Opens external link in new window\">see more...</link>\r\n\r\n  [1]: /static/media/uploads/partnerspages/0d24e7a273.jpg'),(877,'internationalseedfederation','internationalseedfederation',NULL,'-','![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n<p>The <a title=\"Home - International Seed Federation\" href=\"http://www.worldseed.org/isf/home.html\">International Seed Federation</a> (ISF) represents the interests of the professional seed industry at the global level.

Pest introductions and outbreaks cost governments, farmers and consumers billions every year. Once pest species are established their eradication is often impossible, and controlling them takes up a significant percentage of the cost of producing food. The IPPC allows countries to analyze risks to their national plant resources and to use science-based measures to safeguard their cultivated and wild plants. By protecting plant resources from pests and diseases, the IPPC helps: \r\n\r\n - protect farmers from economically devastating pest and disease\r\n - outbreaks;  protect the environment from loss of species diversity; \r\n - protect ecosystems from loss of viability and function as a result of pest invasions; \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n - protect industries and consumers from the costs of pest control or eradication.\r\n\r\nContracting parties to the IPPC share the same goal: to protect the world\'s cultivated and natural plant resources from the spread and introduction of plant pests while minimizing interference with the international movement of goods and people. The IPPC provides an international framework for plant protection that includes developing International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs) for safeguarding plant resources. ISPMs developed as of 31 July 2009 include standards for:\r\n\r\n - procedures and references \r\n - pest surveillance, survey and monitoring \r\n - import regulations and pest risk analysis \r\n - compliance procedures and phytosanitary inspection methodologies \r\n - pest management \r\n - post entry quarantine \r\n - exotic pest emergency response, control and eradication;\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n - export certification.\r\n\r\nThe IPPC also provides information exchange related to import and export requirements, pest status and regulated pest lists provided by each member country. Developing countries also receive technical assistance to support their ability to implement the Convention and the ISPMs. While the IPPC’s primary focus is on plants and plant products moving in international trade, the convention also covers research materials, biological control organisms, germplasm banks, containment facilities and anything else that can act as a vector for the spread of plant pests — for example, containers, packaging materials, soil, vehicles, vessels and machinery. Contracting parties to the IPPC agree to promote technical assistance to other contracting parties. In particular, the Convention encourages support to developing countries to improve the effectiveness of their National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs) and to participate in regional plant protection organizations, to help them realize the benefits of safe trade.','44'),(310,'![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n*Photo: R. Ivess* \r\n\r\nInternational travel and trade are greater than ever before &mdash; and as people and commodities move around the world, organisms that present risks to plants travel with them. Pest introductions cost governments, farmers and consumers billions every year. Once pest species are established their eradication is often impossible, and controlling them takes up a significant percentage of the cost of producing food. The IPPC allows countries to analyze risks to their national plant resources and to use science-based measures to safeguard their cultivated and wild plants. The IPPC is governed by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), which meets annually to promote cooperation to help implement the objectives of the IPPC. In particular, the CPM: \r\n\r\n- reviews the state of plant protection around the world; \r\n- identifies action to control the spread of pests into new areas; \r\n- develops and adopts international standards; \r\n- establishes rules and procedures for resolving disputes; \r\n- establishes rules and procedures for the sharing of phytosanitary information; and \r\n- cooperates with international organizations on matters covered by the Convention. \r\n\r\n\r\n**How can you participate**\r\n\r\nContracting parties participate in implementing the IPPC through: \r\n\r\n- involvement in standard setting activities;\r\n-  the implementation of standards and ISPMs;\r\n-  involvement in Commission on Phytosanitary Measures meetings;\r\n-  membership of international organizations;\r\n-  membership of Regional Plant Protection Organizations;\r\n-  participation through National Plant Protection Organizations;\r\n-  involvement in phytosanitary capacity building;\r\n-  sharing of technical information, experience and expertise; and\r\n-  supporting the IPPC Secretariat by making financial or in kind donations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: /static/media/uploads/abou%20pages/f0cad7b0c2.jpg\r\n','45'),(311,'IPPC works at a global level with Convention **[contracting parties](/countries/all/list-countries/)**, to develop robust and enforceable phytosanitary measures that underpin the parties’ ability to manage pest risks and the environmental, economic and social impacts of plant pests.\r\n\r\n IPPC works with **[Regional Plant Protection Organizations](/partners/regional-plant-protection-organizations/)** and other relevant **[international organizations](/partners/international-organizations/)** to build phytosanitary capacity, to identify and address risks that cross national borders.

The Convention has encouraged countries to ensure through phytosanitary certification that their exports are not the means for introducing new pests to their trading partners. Likewise importing countries strive to ensure that measures they have in place for protection are technically justified. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the IPPC to international trade is strengthened by the WTO-SPS Agreement which names the IPPC as the international organization responsible for phytosanitary standard-setting and the harmonization of phytosanitary measures affecting trade. Both agreements are distinct in their scope purpose and membership. Neither agreement is supplementary to the other. Instead they are complementary in the areas where they overlap. The SPS Agreement makes provision for plant protection in a trade agreement and the IPPC makes provision for trade in a protection agreement. \r\n\r\nThe IPPC is a legally binding international agreement but the standards developed and adopted by the Convention are not legally binding under the IPPC. However WTO members are required to base their phytosanitary measures on international standards developed within the framework of the IPPC. Phytosanitary measures that conform to the ISPMs are presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of the SPS Agreement. Measures that deviate from international standards or measures that exist in the absence of international standards must be developed through the assessment of the risk to plant life or health and must be based on scientific principles and evidence. Emergency (or provisional) measures may be taken without such analyses but must be reviewed in a timely manner for their scientific justification and modified accordingly to be legitimately maintained. \r\n\r\nThe IPPC also has dispute settlement procedures in the instance where measures may be challenged as unjustified barriers to trade. The dispute settlement process under the IPPC offers possibilities for examining controversial issues at a technical level. Although the dispute settlement process in the IPPC is non-binding the results of the process can be expected to have substantial influence in disputes that may be raised to the WTO level under the SPS Agreement.The IPPC has always played an important role in international trade.

Ivess*\r\n\r\nBiosecurity is a key requirement for achieving the goals set out in the FAO Strategic Framework by promoting, developing and re-enforcing policy and regulatory frameworks for food, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. Biosecurity has direct relevance to food safety, the conservation of the environment (including biodiversity), and sustainability of agriculture. Biosecurity encompasses all policy and regulatory frameworks (including instruments and activities) to manage risks associated with food and agriculture (including relevant environmental risks) including fisheries and forestry and constitutes three sectors (namely food safety, plant life and health, and animal life and health). These sectors include food production in relation to food safety the introduction of plant pests animal pests and diseases and zoonoses the introduction and release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and their products and the introduction and safe management of invasive alien species and genotypes. \r\n\r\nGrowing interest in Biosecurity is a result of major international developments such as globalization of the world economy, the rapid increase in volume of communications, transport and trade, technological progress and growing awareness of problems faced by biological diversity and environment. Members require effective efficient improved and updated international frameworks and standards to support appropriate national action. Members also require national frameworks to regulate manage and control biosecurity for food and agriculture including forestry and fisheries thus permitting practical implementation increasing cost effectiveness and improving consistency across sectors. \r\n\r\nRecent developments related to biosecurity in food and agriculture include the tendency toward integration of and cooperation across sectors. Internationally this tendency is demonstrated in the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. It is further addressed in the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The IPPC makes a key contribution to biosecurity by reducing the risks of introduction of plant pests that may affect agriculture and the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: /static/media/uploads/abou%20pages/nl-aalsmeer3-ipp-sg-ag_spotlight.jpg','49'),(315,'The CPM meets annually at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy.

Participants in IPPC activities include virtually all member countries as well as non-contracting parties and many other international, regional and sub-regional organizations.\r\n\r\n Through their National Plant Protection Organizations, individual countries exchange phytosanitary information. \r\n\r\nSee the [Countries](/countries/) section for more information. ','50'),(316,'The concept of international plant protection began in 1881, when five countries signed an agreement to control the spread of grape phylloxera, a North American aphid that was accidentally introduced into Europe around 1865 and that subsequently devastated much of Europe’s grape-growing regions. \r\n\r\nThe next major step was the International Convention for the Protection of Plants, signed in Rome in 1929, followed in 1951 by the adoption of the International Plant Protection Convention — the IPPC — by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \r\n\r\nThe IPPC came into force in April 1952, superseding all previous international plant protection agreements. It was recognized by the 1989 Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a standard setting organization for the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). \r\n\r\nIn 1992 the IPPC Secretariat was established at FAO headquarters in Rome and began its international standard-setting program, which was adopted by FAO the following year. \r\n\r\nIPPC members requested revision of the Convention in 1995 to reflect contemporary phytosanitary concepts and the role of the IPPC in relation to the Uruguay Round Agreements of the World Trade Organization, particularly the SPS Agreement. \r\n\r\nIn the same year the FAO Conference approved the first three international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs) — formal, binding agreements to help protect the world’s plants and plant industries by controlling the spread of plant pests. \r\n\r\nUnder the SPS Agreement, the IPPC provides international standards for phytosanitary measures implemented by governments to protect their plant resources from harmful pests, while ensuring that these measures are justified and are not used as unjustified barriers to international trade. \r\n\r\nThe 29th FAO Conference in 1997 unanimously adopted the New Revised Text of the IPPC, which came into force in 2005. \r\n\r\nThe IPPC Secretariat’s current work programme focuses on the development of ISPMs, the exchange of official information, and capacity building and technical assistance.','51'),(317,'![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n*FAO*\r\n\r\nThe New Revised Text of the IPPC was approved in 1997. Revision was undertaken to reflect contemporary phytosanitary concepts and the role of the IPPC in relation to the Uruguay Round Agreements of the World Trade Organization particularly the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). \r\n\r\nIn particular the SPS Agreement identifies the IPPC as the organization providing international standards for measures implemented by governments to protect their plant resources from harmful pests (phytosanitary measures) while ensuring that phytosanitary measures are technically justified and are not used as unjustified barriers to international trade. \r\n\r\nAlthough the IPPC has strong implications for international trade it has international cooperation for plant protection as its focus. Many forms of cooperation fall within the scope of the Convention. Its application to plants is not limited only to the protection of cultivated plants or direct damage from pests. The scope of the Convention extends to the protection of cultivated and natural flora as well as plant products and includes both direct and indirect damage by pests. \r\n\r\nThe New Revised Text of the IPPC (1997) emphasizes cooperation and the exchange of information toward the objective of global harmonization. In addition to describing national plant protection responsibilities it also addresses important elements of international cooperation for the protection of plant health and the establishment and use of International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs). \r\n\r\nA major objective of the revision was to improve effectiveness in implementation. In this regard FAO has established a Secretariat for the IPPC in the Plant Protection Service Plant Production and Protection Division Agriculture Department. The IPPC Secretariat work programme is broadly focused in three major areas: \r\n\r\n- the development of international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs)\r\n- the exchange of official information in terms of obligations under the IPPC\r\n- capacity building / technical assistance to facilitate the implementation of the IPPC<\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: /static/media/uploads/abou%20pages/picture2b.jpg','52'),(318,'\r\n\r\nThe New Revised Text of the IPPC (1997) entered into force on 2 October 2005 (the thirtieth day after it was accepted by two-thirds of the contracting parties to the IPPC - see Article XXI.4 of the New Revised Text).

implemented by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), which facilitates cooperation between contracting parties to protect the world\'s cultivated and natural plant resources from the spread and introduction of pests of plants, while minimizing interference with the international movement of goods and people. The CPM\'s core activities are identified in its Business Plan and planned through consultation with contracting parties. All activities have associated measures of success to enable progress with achievement to be monitored. IPPC\'s core activities include:\r\n\r\n- [Governance](/core-activities/governance)\r\n- [Standard setting](/core-activities/standards-setting \"Opens internal link in current window\")\r\n- [Information exchange](/core-activities/information-exchange \"Opens internal link in current window\")\r\n- [Dispute settlement](/core-activities/dispute-settlement \"Opens internal link in current window\")\r\n- [Capacity building](/core-activities/capacity-development \"Opens internal link in current window\")\r\n- [Reviewing the global status of plant protection](/core-activities/review-global-plant-protection \"Opens internal link in current window\")','56'),(323,'The [Commission on Phytosanitary Measures](/core-activities/governance/cpm)(CPM) is the governing body of the IPPC. CPM&rsquo;s mission is cooperation between nations in protecting the world\'s cultivated and natural plant resources from the spread and introduction of pests of plants, while minimizing interference with the international movement of goods and people. \r\n\r\nThe CPM meets annually and is directed between sessions by the [CPM Bureau](/core-activities/governance/bureau), which provides advice and administration and makes decisions between annual CPM meetings. \r\n\r\nThere are two subsidiary bodies to the CPM: the [Standards Committee](/core-activities/standards-setting/standards-committee) and the [Subsidiary Body on Dispute Settlement]( https://www.ippc.int/core-activities/dispute-avoidance-dispute-settlement/subsidiary-body-dispute-settlement). \r\n\r\nThe IPPC Secretariat is responsible for coordinating the IPPC work programme, which involves:\r\n\r\n-  Developing [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures](/core-activities/standards-setting/ispms) ([Standard setting](/core-activities/standards-setting))\r\n-  Providing information required by the IPPC, and facilitating [information exchange](/core-activities/information-exchange) between contracting parties (Information exchange); and\r\n-  Providing technical assistance &mdash; especially for capacity building &mdash; to facilitate the implementation of the IPPC ([Capacity Development](/core-activities/capacity-development))\r\n-  The [Strategic Planning and Technical Assistance](/core-activities/governance/strategic-planning-group) (SPTA) group is an informal working group that prepares specific activities for the CPM relating to planning and prioritization of the work programme, including technical assistance, information exchange, prioritizing topics for standards, funding issues, and decisions regarding liaison with other international and regional organisations. The SPTA meets during the first week of October each year at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy.','59'),(324,' ![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n[Jump to Publications ?](#cpm-publication-page)\r\n\r\nThe IPPC is governed by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), which was established under Article XII of the New Revised Text of the IPPC, approved in 1997, and serves as the Convention\'s governing body. The CPM meets during March or April each year at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, to promote cooperation to help implement the objectives of the IPPC. In particular, the Commission: \r\n\r\n- reviews the state of plant protection around the world \r\n- identifies action to control the spread of pests into new areas \r\n- develops and adopts international standards \r\n- establishes rules and procedures for resolving disputes \r\n- adopts guidelines for the recognition of regional plant protection organizations; and \r\n- cooperates with international organizations on matters covered by the Convention \r\n\r\nThe members of the Commission are the contracting parties to the Convention and are responsible for implementing the work programme of standards development, information exchange and capacity building. Commission meetings are attended by contracting parties and by observers from organizations such as the Regional Plant Protection Organizations, the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee, the Standards and Trade Development Facility, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Meetings also host a scientific session for discussion of important issues. Past sessions have covered topics such as pest movements through food aid shipments and the potential impact of climate change on the spread of invasive alien species.\r\n\r\n CPM documents are posted on this page as they become available. Due to the fact that the CPM documents are created in a template which supports only .docx format and not all users can open this format, we will only post the documents in PDF.\r\n\r\n **Please note that in 2014, the effort continues to reduce the amount of paper used at CPM. As in 2013, there will be a very limited number of copies of the papers available. Please download your own documents or download them onto your computer.** \r\n \r\n **Please note that in some cases English version of the CPM document has been revised after first time posting on IPP, before the other language versions were available. The new revised document in English is now named : En_rev.01.

It provides specific recommendations regarding the role of the ICPM members and the Secretariat in information exchange. The recommendation stresses the importance of information exchange and especially the communication of information in electronic formats. It also recommends country participation on linguistic issues on proposed ISPMs. </p> <p> <strong>Addressed to:</strong> </p> <p> ICPM members and the IPPC Secretary. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation :</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>urges</em>: </p> <p> <strong> Members:</strong> </p> <p> i. to meet their obligations and provide information in relation to Article VII 2(d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4; </p> <p> ii. to encourage the use electronic means for dissemination of information in relation to Article VII 2 (b), 2(d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4. </p> <p> <strong> the Secretary:</strong> </p> <p> i. to request information from the official contact points in relation to Article VII 2 (d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4; </p> <p> ii. to request the Contracting Parties to indicate their preference for future communication in electronic format or as printed material, and to disseminate information accordingly in future; </p> <p> iii. to endeavour to facilitate the translation process by offering Contracting Parties the chance to comment on linguistic issues on proposed international standards before the adoption and to identify the definitive text. </p> <p> 2. That the proposed ISPM on \"Guidelines for the preparation of regulated pests lists\" should include provisions in relation to reporting responsibilities and, noting the importance of the dissemination of phytosanitary regulations, that the ICPM should give guidance on the interpretation of Articles XII 2 (d) and VII 2 (b), in particular on the obligations of contracting parties and the IPPC Secretariat. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation(s) superseded by the above</strong> : </p> <p> None </p><br clear=\"all\" /> <p><a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#top\">Back to top</a></p> <h2 id=\"ICPM-3\">CPM Recommendation ICPM-3/1 <span class=\"normal\">- ICPM Recommendations Concerning Living Modified Organisms, Biosecurity and Alien Invasive Species</span></h2> <p> <strong>Background</strong>: </p> <p> This Recommendation was adopted at ICPM-3 in 2001 (see report of ICPM-3, paragraph 34 &amp; Appendix XIII). It provides specific recommendations regarding the role of the IPPC, the ICPM members and the Secretariat in regard to living modified organisms and alien invasive species. The decisions and recommendations also provide guidelines for the communication and cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p> <p> <strong>Addressed to :</strong> </p> <p> ICPM members, ICPM Bureau and the IPPC Secretariat. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation :</strong> </p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> <strong>PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND ACTIVITIES OF THE IPPC</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> the statements that: </p> <p> a) the purpose of the Convention is \" to secure common and effective action to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriate measures for their control \" (Art 1.1). This is done with the desire to provide a framework for the development and application of harmonized phytosanitary measures and the elaboration of international standards, and taking into account internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human, and animal health, and the environment. </p> <p> b) plants are not limited to cultivated plants and protection is not limited to direct damage from pests. The IPPC definition of a pest is \" any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products \". The coverage of the IPPC definition of plant pests includes weeds and other species that have indirect effects on plants. Therefore the scope of the Convention applies to the protection of wild flora resulting in an important contribution to the conservation of biological diversity. </p> <p> c) the IPPC provides for rights and obligations supported by a system of standards and procedures for identifying pests that threaten plant health, assessing their risk, and determining the strength of measures to be used against their introduction and spread. Under the IPPC, most countries have established regulatory organizations experienced in assessing and managing the risk of pests that threaten plant health. </p> <p> d) although the IPPC clearly has applications to the spread of pests associated with international trade, the Convention is not limited in this respect. International cooperation in many forms falls within the scope of the Convention. The IPPC works collaboratively with other relevant organizations to avoid duplication and encourage harmonization for the implementation of obligations under other instruments. </p> <p> <strong>B.</strong> <strong>ROLE OF THE IPPC REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) consistent with the IPPC mandate to protect plant health, plant pest concerns that may be presented by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology fall within the scope of the IPPC. </p> <p> b) IPPC risk analysis and management systems are appropriate for assessing and managing, if necessary, the direct or indirect risks of pests to cultivated and wild flora and plant products that may be presented by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> c) IPPC systems and procedures are relevant to, and adequate for, managing the risks posed by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology as they relate to the protection of plant health. </p> <p> d) the existing national mechanisms and structures for phytosanitary systems may form a basis or a model for developing other practical approaches to managing risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> <strong>C.</strong> <strong>NECESSITY OF DRAFTING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that plant pest risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology fall clearly within the scope of the IPPC. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>recommends</em> that: </p> <p> a) as a matter of urgency an IPPC expert working group in coordination with CBD experts, and other relevant expertise, is established to develop a detailed standard specification for consideration at the ICPM. The terms of reference will include: </p> <p> i) consideration of the existing international regulatory frameworks and guidelines; </p> <p> ii) the identification of areas within pest risk analysis (PRA) standards and other ISPMs that are relevant to the phytosanitary aspects of LMOs/products of modern biotechnology; </p> <p> iii) the identification of plant pest risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology that are not adequately addressed by existing ISPMs; and </p> <p> iv) the identification of elements relevant to the assessment of the plant pest risk associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> b) the IPPC Secretariat cooperate with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat and ensure that appropriate information on the IPPC is provided to appropriate meetings on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the CBD. </p> <p> c) the Interim Standards Committee not re-open the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests (under country consultation at the time of the working group meeting) to incorporate provisions for LMOs/products of modern biotechnology but consider adding a reference to the development of a supplementary standard. </p> <p> <strong>D.</strong> <strong>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVASIVE SPECIES AND QUARANTINE PESTS</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) species that may be invasive and that directly or indirectly affect plants or plant products or that may be used as biological control agents should be assessed, monitored and managed if necessary according to IPPC provisions and standards. </p> <p> b) those species that are identified under heading E, paragrah 1(a) and that are absent (not present) from an area (or if present, are limited in distribution and subject to official control) should be considered quarantine pests and should be subjected to measures according to IPPC provisions and standards. </p> <p> <strong>E.</strong> <strong>ROLE OF THE IPPC REGARDING ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) the IPPC provides for rights and obligations, and has established standards and procedures that are designed to prevent the introduction and spread of pests of plants and plant products, which include alien invasive species. </p> <p> b) the implementation of IPPC including its provisions and standards is directly relevant to the national implementation of Art. 8(h) and other relevant articles and activities of the CBD and the further development of the CBD work programme on alien species. Furthermore it is directly relevant and overlaps with the apparent intention of the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD. </p> <p> c) many provisions and standards of the IPPC are directly relevant to, or overlap with, the apparent scope and intention of the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD. </p> <p> Relevant areas include: </p> <ul> <li> providing legal and regulatory frameworks; </li> <li> building capacity and technical assistance for developing countries; </li> <li> assessing and managing potential plant pest risks; </li> <li> protecting areas that may be threatened by plant pests; </li> <li> applying measures to prevent unintentional introduction of plant pests; </li> <li> certifying that risk management procedures have been applied; </li> <li> assessing and managing the intentional introduction of organisms that may be pests of plants including claimed beneficial and biological control organisms; </li> <li> exchanging of scientific and regulatory information relevant to plant pests; </li> <li> cooperating between countries to minimize the impact of plant pests; and </li> <li> detecting, controlling, and eradicating pests in agricultural and wild flora. </li> </ul> <p> d) in addition to IPPC provisions relevant to the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD, the IPPC also has established standards and operational procedures developed from long experience in managing plant pest risk. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that the IPPC Secretariat seek clarification of the terminology and concepts used in, and the responsibilities imposed by, the Interim Guiding Principles be sought from the CBD. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM <em>strongly urges</em> NPPOs to communicate the scope and responsibility of the IPPC to officials in their countries involved in the CBD workplan on alien invasive species (including the Interim Guiding Principles). </p> <p> 4. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that the Secretariat of the IPPC prepare a factual outline of the relationships between specific IPPC Articles and standards and the topics identified in the individual Interim Guiding Principles. This is intended to assist IPPC members in in-country consultations. </p> <p> <strong>F.</strong> <strong>THE NECESSITY OF DRAFTING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES REGARDING ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM: </p> <p> a) <em>endorses</em> that:environmental concerns related to plant pests are specified in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No. 2 Guidelines for pest risk analysis . Further detail is provided in the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests but needs further elaboration to help contracting parties better assess environmental concerns related to plant pests. </p> <p> b) <em>notes</em> that some countries use IPPC-PRA methodology and management systems for dealing with environmental impacts of plant pests mainly in the horticulture, agriculture and forestry sectors, but in accordance with the IPPC mandate, these systems are used more widely in other countries. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) the ICPM review standards as soon as possible to ensure that they adequately address environmental risks of plant pests. </p> <p> b) delay in the approval of the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests to allow further elaboration on environmental concerns related to plant pests should be avoided. </p> <p> c) in order to clarify the role of the IPPC and assist contracting parties with their rights and obligations, the ICPM develop a supplementary standard to the PRA standard addressing in detail the environmental risks associated with plant pests as a matter of urgency. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM <em>recognizes</em> in particular that under the IPPC^s existing mandate, to take account of environmental concerns, further clarification should include consideration of the following five proposed points relating to potential environmental risks of plant pests: </p> <ul> <li> reduction or elimination of endangered (or threatened) native plant species; </li> <li> reduction or elimination of a keystone plant species (a species which plays a major role in the maintenance of an ecosystem); </li> <li> reduction or elimination of a plant species which is a major component of a native ecosystem; </li> <li> causing a change to plant biological diversity in such a way as to result in ecosystem destabilization; </li> <li> resulting in control, eradication or management programs that would be needed if a quarantine pest were introduced, and impacts of such programs (e.g. pesticides or release of nonindigenous predators and parasites) on biological diversity. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>G.</strong> <strong>CAPACITY BUILDING REGARDING IPPC ASPECTS OF LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM urges countries to identify their phytosanitary capacity-building needs and recognize the special needs of developing countries regarding LMOs/products of modern biotechnology, and alien invasive species </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) IPPC aspects of LMOs/products of modern biotechnology and alien invasive species, and relevant environmental risk issues be included in appropriate IPPC capacity building activities. </p> <p> b) ICPM work with CBD and other relevant bodies to develop and deliver appropriate programs that meet the needs of countries in regard to common areas of interest. </p> <p> <strong>H.</strong> <strong>COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>recognizes</em> that LMOs/products of modern biotechnology and invasive species are covered by various international agreements and initiatives. As a consequence the ICPM considered it necessary, in order to reach the objective of coherence and mutual support in the implementation of these agreements, to strengthen the cooperation between the IPPC and the CBD; </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) when appropriate the Bureau and the Secretariat invite members of the ICPM to attend relevant meetings on behalf of the ICPM. </p> <p> b) the IPPC Secretariat seek observer status with the CBD for the IPPC in its own right. </p> <p> c) the IPPC Secretariat work closely with the CBD Secretariat and attend relevant CBD meetings, and that the CBD be invited by the IPPC Secretariat to attend relevant IPPC meetings. </p> <p> d) the IPPC Secretariat cooperate with other standard setting bodies to ensure that common areas of interest are adequately covered. </p> <p> e) communication and cooperation issues be addressed as part of the strategic planning process of the ICPM. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM s <em>trongly urges</em> members of the ICPM to communicate IPPC interests and issues to in-country officials with responsibility for CBD matters, including the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), and issues dealing with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to ensure that the obligations under the IPPC are understood and considered as appropriate in developing positions. This includes: </p> <ul> <li> contacting the appropriate incountry officials; </li> <li> informing them of the IPPC and how those objectives are met by countries (legislation, policies, programs); </li> <li> outlining how and which standards for phytosanitary measures contribute to those objectives; </li> <li> assisting incountry preparations for CBD, SBSTTA, Cartagena Protocol and related activities. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Recommendation(s) superseded by the above</strong> : </p> <p> None </p><br clear=\"all\" /> <p><a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#top\">Back to top</a></p> <h2 id=\"ICPM-7\">CPM Recommendation ICPM-7/1 <span class=\"normal\">- Threats to Biodiversity posed by Alien Species: Actions within the Framework of the IPPC</span></h2> </p> <p> <strong>Background</strong> : </p> <p> This Recommendation was adopted at ICPM-7 in 2005 (see report of ICPM-7, paragraph 148).

With the overall aim of reducing release of methyl bromide into the atmosphere, NPPOs may consider methods of reducing the quantities of methyl bromide used, reducing methyl bromide emissions by physical means, and promoting and implementing phytosanitary measures that are economically and technically feasible as viable alternatives to the use of methyl bromide. The IPPC Recommendation also provides guidance on recording the use of methyl bromide. </p><strong><br clear=\"all\" /></strong> <p> <strong>Background</strong> </p> <p> The main purpose of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the responsibility of its contracting parties is to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products and to promote appropriate measures for their control. In doing so, contracting parties also undertake the promotion of appropriate measures for the control of regulated pests. In its preamble, the IPPC states that in agreeing to the Convention, contracting parties take into account \"internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human and animal health, and the environment\". The second meeting of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM) \"Encouraged contracting parties to promote best fumigation practices, recapture technology and development and use of alternatives to methyl bromide in phytosanitary measures where this was technically and economically feasible\". Thus, while pursuing the IPPC^s purpose, contracting parties are also encouraged to take into account environmental concerns, among which is protection of the ozone layer by reducing methyl bromide emissions. </p> <p> IPPC contracting parties may also be party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Signatories to the Montreal Protocol are obliged to protect the ozone layer by reducing, and ultimately eliminating, emissions of ozone-depleting substances through a phase-out of production and import and consumption of such substances, noting the quarantine and pre-shipment (QPS) <a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[2]</ins></a> exemptions. </p> <p> In the 1992 Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, methyl bromide was listed as an ozone-depleting substance subject to phase-out provisions of the Montreal Protocol. However, the use of methyl bromide for QPS purposes is currently exempt from the protocol^s phase-out provisions because of difficulties in identifying technically and economically feasible alternatives. There is currently no limit on the amount of methyl bromide that can be used for these QPS purposes. In 1999, in the Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, mandatory requirements for the provision of statistical data on amounts of methyl bromide used annually for QPS purposes were agreed to. This amendment entered into force in January 2001. Therefore, parties to the Montreal Protocol already have obligations to monitor and report their use of methyl bromide for QPS applications. </p> <p> Methyl bromide has been widely used as a pest control treatment for many decades. It offers a broad spectrum of control for insects, nematodes, weeds, pathogens and rodents. Methyl bromide has been employed primarily as a soil fumigant before planting crops, and is also used for commodity treatment and structural fumigation. Most uses of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure are for the treatment of durable commodities, such as grains, cereals and dried foodstuffs, wood packaging materials, wood and logs, as well as perishable commodities, such as fruit. </p> <p> It is recognized that alternatives to methyl bromide for use as phytosanitary measures are needed, particularly because there may be future restrictions on the use of methyl bromide. It is also recognized that there is a need for contracting parties to continue to use methyl bromide until equivalent and feasible alternative phytosanitary measures are available. </p> <p> Some countries have already successfully reduced or eliminated the use of methyl bromide. </p> <p> To be considered viable under the IPPC, phytosanitary measures that are alternatives to methyl bromide and that are equivalent to methyl bromide fumigation as per ISPM No. 24 ( <em>Guidelines for the determination and recognition of equivalence of phytosanitary measures</em> ) should also be economically and technically feasible. In comparison, the United Nations Environment Programme^s Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee defined alternatives as \"those non-chemical or chemical treatments and/or procedures that are technically feasible for controlling pests, thus avoiding or replacing the use of methyl bromide\". <a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[3]</ins></a> </p> <p> <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong> </p> <p> To reduce the risk of introduction of some quarantine pests, the need for methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure remains until a range of equivalent alternatives has been developed. Contracting parties are encouraged to put in place a strategy that will help them to reduce the use of methyl bromide for phytosanitary measures and/or reduce emissions of methyl bromide. This may include the following areas for action: </p> <ul> <li> replacing methyl bromide use </li> <li> reducing methyl bromide use </li> <li> physically reducing methyl bromide emissions </li> <li> accurately recording methyl bromide use for phytosanitary measures. </li> </ul> <p> In developing and implementing strategies to replace and/or reduce methyl bromide use and reduce emissions, contracting parties should also take into account any international obligations to which they may be subject and relevant IPPC principles. These principles are described in ISPM No. 1 (<em>Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary measures in international trade</em>). </p> <p> <strong>1. Replacement of Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> In recognition of the desire to minimize the use of methyl bromide, contracting parties should, where possible, take actions to replace methyl bromide usage by increasing the application of alternative phytosanitary measures. Where methyl bromide fumigation is currently used as a phytosanitary treatment for regulated pests it may be replaced by an alternative phytosanitary measure in which no methyl bromide is used. This may involve the implementation of systems approaches, pest free areas (PFAs), areas of low pest prevalence (ALPPs), pest free places of production, pest free production sites and equivalence. </p> <p> The following are examples of phytosanitary measures that may be implemented independently or in conjunction with other phytosanitary measures to replace methyl bromide as a phytosanitary treatment when equivalent: </p> <ul> <li> use of other chemicals such as treatments mentioned in Appendix 1 (e.g. sulfuryl fluoride) </li> <li> application of physical treatments (e.g. heating, cooling, irradiation) </li> <li> immediate commodity processing (e.g. grain being milled into flour on arrival) </li> <li> methods of production (e.g. soil-free growing media, tissue culture, sterile culture). </li> </ul> <p> In situations where consignments are identified as non-compliant at the point of import, the use of methyl bromide should be avoided where possible (appropriate actions to be taken in the case of non-compliance are described in section 5.1.6.1 of ISPM No. 20: <em>Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system</em> ). </p> <p> The CPM, largely through the provisions of ISPM No. 28 (<em>Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests</em>), is actively pursuing adoption of treatments that are viable alternatives to methyl bromide. As these alternatives become recognized, contracting parties are encouraged to use them in place of methyl bromide, where appropriate. </p> <p> Where an ISPM contains options for various treatments for a commodity, and one of the options is methyl bromide (currently the only ISPM for which this is the case is ISPM No. 15: <em>Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade</em>) and others are considered to present less of an adverse environmental impact, parties are encouraged to use the lower-impact option(s). </p> <p> Appendix 1 contains a list of articles that have historically been treated with methyl bromide and presents possible alternative phytosanitary treatments that could be used to replace or reduce the use of methyl bromide. </p> <p> <strong>2. Reducing Volumes of Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> The reduction of methyl bromide emissions can be achieved through the use of reduced dosages of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure or decreased treatment frequency. In addition, existing methyl bromide use should be analysed carefully to determine if the treatment is appropriate and necessary. </p> <p> The following approaches may, where appropriate, be pursued to reduce the use of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure: </p> <ul> <li> inspection-based fumigation instead of mandatory fumigation (i.e. to detect and identify the quarantine pest of concern ) </li> <li> avoidance of unjustified re-fumigation with methyl bromide (i.e. re-fumigation should be used only when a quarantine pest situation is evident) </li> <li> improvement of treatment facilities as appropriate to maximize efficiency of fumigation, thus reducing replenishment or re-fumigation requirements </li> <li> increasing exposure time with a view to reducing dosage, where technically feasible </li> <li> compliance with phytosanitary requirements for exporting commodities </li> <li> avoidance of application in situations where efficacy is doubtful or marginal </li> <li> re assessment of doses and exposure times in order to reduce them </li> <li> use of optimal temperatures when fumigating </li> <li> use of appropriately sized treatment facilities </li> <li> evaluation of pest risk and treatment efficacy (through a pest risk analysis) to determine if a more appropriate dose or alternative treatment is possible. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>3. Physically Reducing Methyl Bromide Emissions</strong> </p> <p> Contracting parties should aim to minimize or eliminate the release of methyl bromide to the atmosphere by physical means. This may be achieved by upgrading facilities as appropriate to increase efficiency of methyl bromide application to improve: </p> <ul> <li> methyl bromide emissions control, e.g. by recapture, and/or reuse or destruction, through the use of leak-proof chambers and containment/capture bubbles, etc. </li> <li> fumigation performance, e.g. by use of bioassay controls where appropriate in lieu of concentration ? time products, use of higher temperatures during fumigation through supplemental heat when necessary combined with air circulation, pressure testing etc., reduction of leakage </li> <li> gas circulation, e.g. by use of a carrier gas such as CO<sub>2</sub> </li> <li> gas and temperature monitoring including proper calibration of equipment. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>4. Recording Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> To measure progress in reduction of methyl bromide emissions arising from use of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure, NPPOs are encouraged to accurately record and collate data on current usage and share this data with their country^s National Ozone Unit <a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[4]</ins></a> ( the national body responsible for the implementation of the Montreal Protocol). </p> <p> The information on methyl bromide use for phytosanitary measures should contain: </p> <ul> <li> quantities of methyl bromide used in kilograms </li> <li> description of the articles <a href=\"index.php?id=1111093&amp;L=0#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[5]</ins></a> fumigated where appropriate </li> <li> whether the use was on import or export commodities </li> <li> target pests. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>5. Guidelines for Appropriate Use of Methyl Bromide as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> NPPOs are encouraged to be involved in the coordination of the following actions: </p> <p> 1. Review and consider how to change phytosanitary policies (e.g. phytosanitary import requirements) to replace and/or reduce methyl bromide where it is required and where an equivalent, technically feasible, practical and economically viable alternative exists. This may also require review and revision of bilateral agreements between countries. </p> <p> 2. Ensure that methyl bromide fumigation is used only for quarantine pests and that it is authorized or performed by the NPPO, including fumigation as emergency action for pests not previously assessed (as described in section 5.1.6.2 of ISPM No. 20: <em>Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system</em>). </p> <p> 3. Provide guidance to those responsible for methyl bromide fumigations for quarantine purposes on the importance of pursuing feasible alternative phytosanitary measures. </p> <p> 4. Develop and utilize phytosanitary measures that are equivalent, viable and feasible alternatives to methyl bromide. </p> <p> 5. Communicate to other NPPOs where there are viable alternatives to methyl bromide use. </p> <p> 6. Submit phytosanitary treatments that are effective, efficacious, documented, feasible and applicable alternatives to the use of methyl bromide to the IPPC Secretariat using the guidelines in ISPM No. 28 (<em>Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests</em>). </p> <p> 7. Give highest priority to the development of alternative treatments for those commodities for which methyl bromide usage is high. </p> <p> 8. Liaise with research groups and funding bodies to develop alternative treatments as appropriate. </p> <p> 9. Coordinate with the National Ozone Unit, as appropriate, to facilitate the annual collection and reporting of methyl bromide usage data. </p> <p> 10. Post or link details of NPPO-approved alternatives for methyl bromide treatment on the International Phytosanitary Portal (<a href=\"https://www.ippc.int/\">https://www.ippc.int</a>) for exchange of information. </p> <p> 11. Cooperate with the National Ozone Unit to implement a strategy to replace and reduce methyl bromide usage. </p> <p> 12.

The recommendation stresses the importance of information exchange and especially the communication of information in electronic formats. It also recommends country participation on linguistic issues on proposed ISPMs. </p> <p> <strong>Addressed to:</strong> </p> <p> ICPM members and the IPPC Secretary. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation :</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>urges</em>: </p> <p> <strong> Members:</strong> </p> <p> i. to meet their obligations and provide information in relation to Article VII 2(d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4; </p> <p> ii. to encourage the use electronic means for dissemination of information in relation to Article VII 2 (b), 2(d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4. </p> <p> <strong> the Secretary:</strong> </p> <p> i. to request information from the official contact points in relation to Article VII 2 (d), 2 (i) and Article IV 4; </p> <p> ii. to request the Contracting Parties to indicate their preference for future communication in electronic format or as printed material, and to disseminate information accordingly in future; </p> <p> iii. to endeavour to facilitate the translation process by offering Contracting Parties the chance to comment on linguistic issues on proposed international standards before the adoption and to identify the definitive text. </p> <p> 2.

It provides specific recommendations regarding the role of the IPPC, the ICPM members and the Secretariat in regard to living modified organisms and alien invasive species. The decisions and recommendations also provide guidelines for the communication and cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p> <p> <strong>Addressed to :</strong> </p> <p> ICPM members, ICPM Bureau and the IPPC Secretariat. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation :</strong> </p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> <strong>PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND ACTIVITIES OF THE IPPC</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> the statements that: </p> <p> a) the purpose of the Convention is \" to secure common and effective action to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriate measures for their control \" (Art 1.1). This is done with the desire to provide a framework for the development and application of harmonized phytosanitary measures and the elaboration of international standards, and taking into account internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human, and animal health, and the environment. </p> <p> b) plants are not limited to cultivated plants and protection is not limited to direct damage from pests. The IPPC definition of a pest is \" any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products \". The coverage of the IPPC definition of plant pests includes weeds and other species that have indirect effects on plants. Therefore the scope of the Convention applies to the protection of wild flora resulting in an important contribution to the conservation of biological diversity. </p> <p> c) the IPPC provides for rights and obligations supported by a system of standards and procedures for identifying pests that threaten plant health, assessing their risk, and determining the strength of measures to be used against their introduction and spread. Under the IPPC, most countries have established regulatory organizations experienced in assessing and managing the risk of pests that threaten plant health. </p> <p> d) although the IPPC clearly has applications to the spread of pests associated with international trade, the Convention is not limited in this respect. International cooperation in many forms falls within the scope of the Convention. The IPPC works collaboratively with other relevant organizations to avoid duplication and encourage harmonization for the implementation of obligations under other instruments. </p> <p> <strong>B.</strong> <strong>ROLE OF THE IPPC REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) consistent with the IPPC mandate to protect plant health, plant pest concerns that may be presented by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology fall within the scope of the IPPC. </p> <p> b) IPPC risk analysis and management systems are appropriate for assessing and managing, if necessary, the direct or indirect risks of pests to cultivated and wild flora and plant products that may be presented by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> c) IPPC systems and procedures are relevant to, and adequate for, managing the risks posed by LMOs/products of modern biotechnology as they relate to the protection of plant health. </p> <p> d) the existing national mechanisms and structures for phytosanitary systems may form a basis or a model for developing other practical approaches to managing risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> <strong>C.</strong> <strong>NECESSITY OF DRAFTING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that plant pest risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology fall clearly within the scope of the IPPC. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>recommends</em> that: </p> <p> a) as a matter of urgency an IPPC expert working group in coordination with CBD experts, and other relevant expertise, is established to develop a detailed standard specification for consideration at the ICPM. The terms of reference will include: </p> <p> i) consideration of the existing international regulatory frameworks and guidelines; </p> <p> ii) the identification of areas within pest risk analysis (PRA) standards and other ISPMs that are relevant to the phytosanitary aspects of LMOs/products of modern biotechnology; </p> <p> iii) the identification of plant pest risks associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology that are not adequately addressed by existing ISPMs; and </p> <p> iv) the identification of elements relevant to the assessment of the plant pest risk associated with LMOs/products of modern biotechnology. </p> <p> b) the IPPC Secretariat cooperate with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat and ensure that appropriate information on the IPPC is provided to appropriate meetings on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the CBD. </p> <p> c) the Interim Standards Committee not re-open the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests (under country consultation at the time of the working group meeting) to incorporate provisions for LMOs/products of modern biotechnology but consider adding a reference to the development of a supplementary standard. </p> <p> <strong>D.</strong> <strong>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVASIVE SPECIES AND QUARANTINE PESTS</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) species that may be invasive and that directly or indirectly affect plants or plant products or that may be used as biological control agents should be assessed, monitored and managed if necessary according to IPPC provisions and standards. </p> <p> b) those species that are identified under heading E, paragrah 1(a) and that are absent (not present) from an area (or if present, are limited in distribution and subject to official control) should be considered quarantine pests and should be subjected to measures according to IPPC provisions and standards. </p> <p> <strong>E.</strong> <strong>ROLE OF THE IPPC REGARDING ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>endorses</em> that: </p> <p> a) the IPPC provides for rights and obligations, and has established standards and procedures that are designed to prevent the introduction and spread of pests of plants and plant products, which include alien invasive species. </p> <p> b) the implementation of IPPC including its provisions and standards is directly relevant to the national implementation of Art. 8(h) and other relevant articles and activities of the CBD and the further development of the CBD work programme on alien species. Furthermore it is directly relevant and overlaps with the apparent intention of the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD. </p> <p> c) many provisions and standards of the IPPC are directly relevant to, or overlap with, the apparent scope and intention of the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD. </p> <p> Relevant areas include: </p> <ul> <li> providing legal and regulatory frameworks; </li> <li> building capacity and technical assistance for developing countries; </li> <li> assessing and managing potential plant pest risks; </li> <li> protecting areas that may be threatened by plant pests; </li> <li> applying measures to prevent unintentional introduction of plant pests; </li> <li> certifying that risk management procedures have been applied; </li> <li> assessing and managing the intentional introduction of organisms that may be pests of plants including claimed beneficial and biological control organisms; </li> <li> exchanging of scientific and regulatory information relevant to plant pests; </li> <li> cooperating between countries to minimize the impact of plant pests; and </li> <li> detecting, controlling, and eradicating pests in agricultural and wild flora. </li> </ul> <p> d) in addition to IPPC provisions relevant to the Interim Guiding Principles of the CBD, the IPPC also has established standards and operational procedures developed from long experience in managing plant pest risk. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that the IPPC Secretariat seek clarification of the terminology and concepts used in, and the responsibilities imposed by, the Interim Guiding Principles be sought from the CBD. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM <em>strongly urges</em> NPPOs to communicate the scope and responsibility of the IPPC to officials in their countries involved in the CBD workplan on alien invasive species (including the Interim Guiding Principles). </p> <p> 4. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that the Secretariat of the IPPC prepare a factual outline of the relationships between specific IPPC Articles and standards and the topics identified in the individual Interim Guiding Principles. This is intended to assist IPPC members in in-country consultations. </p> <p> <strong>F.</strong> <strong>THE NECESSITY OF DRAFTING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES REGARDING ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM: </p> <p> a) <em>endorses</em> that:environmental concerns related to plant pests are specified in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No. 2 Guidelines for pest risk analysis . Further detail is provided in the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests but needs further elaboration to help contracting parties better assess environmental concerns related to plant pests. </p> <p> b) <em>notes</em> that some countries use IPPC-PRA methodology and management systems for dealing with environmental impacts of plant pests mainly in the horticulture, agriculture and forestry sectors, but in accordance with the IPPC mandate, these systems are used more widely in other countries. </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) the ICPM review standards as soon as possible to ensure that they adequately address environmental risks of plant pests. </p> <p> b) delay in the approval of the September 1999 draft ISPM Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests to allow further elaboration on environmental concerns related to plant pests should be avoided. </p> <p> c) in order to clarify the role of the IPPC and assist contracting parties with their rights and obligations, the ICPM develop a supplementary standard to the PRA standard addressing in detail the environmental risks associated with plant pests as a matter of urgency. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM <em>recognizes</em> in particular that under the IPPC^s existing mandate, to take account of environmental concerns, further clarification should include consideration of the following five proposed points relating to potential environmental risks of plant pests: </p> <ul> <li> reduction or elimination of endangered (or threatened) native plant species; </li> <li> reduction or elimination of a keystone plant species (a species which plays a major role in the maintenance of an ecosystem); </li> <li> reduction or elimination of a plant species which is a major component of a native ecosystem; </li> <li> causing a change to plant biological diversity in such a way as to result in ecosystem destabilization; </li> <li> resulting in control, eradication or management programs that would be needed if a quarantine pest were introduced, and impacts of such programs (e.g. pesticides or release of nonindigenous predators and parasites) on biological diversity. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>G.</strong> <strong>CAPACITY BUILDING REGARDING IPPC ASPECTS OF LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM urges countries to identify their phytosanitary capacity-building needs and recognize the special needs of developing countries regarding LMOs/products of modern biotechnology, and alien invasive species </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) IPPC aspects of LMOs/products of modern biotechnology and alien invasive species, and relevant environmental risk issues be included in appropriate IPPC capacity building activities. </p> <p> b) ICPM work with CBD and other relevant bodies to develop and deliver appropriate programs that meet the needs of countries in regard to common areas of interest. </p> <p> <strong>H.</strong> <strong>COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION REGARDING LMOS/PRODUCTS OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES</strong> </p> <p> 1. The ICPM <em>recognizes</em> that LMOs/products of modern biotechnology and invasive species are covered by various international agreements and initiatives. As a consequence the ICPM considered it necessary, in order to reach the objective of coherence and mutual support in the implementation of these agreements, to strengthen the cooperation between the IPPC and the CBD; </p> <p> 2. The ICPM <em>agrees</em> that: </p> <p> a) when appropriate the Bureau and the Secretariat invite members of the ICPM to attend relevant meetings on behalf of the ICPM. </p> <p> b) the IPPC Secretariat seek observer status with the CBD for the IPPC in its own right. </p> <p> c) the IPPC Secretariat work closely with the CBD Secretariat and attend relevant CBD meetings, and that the CBD be invited by the IPPC Secretariat to attend relevant IPPC meetings. </p> <p> d) the IPPC Secretariat cooperate with other standard setting bodies to ensure that common areas of interest are adequately covered. </p> <p> e) communication and cooperation issues be addressed as part of the strategic planning process of the ICPM. </p> <p> 3. The ICPM s <em>trongly urges</em> members of the ICPM to communicate IPPC interests and issues to in-country officials with responsibility for CBD matters, including the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), and issues dealing with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to ensure that the obligations under the IPPC are understood and considered as appropriate in developing positions. This includes: </p> <ul> <li> contacting the appropriate incountry officials; </li> <li> informing them of the IPPC and how those objectives are met by countries (legislation, policies, programs); </li> <li> outlining how and which standards for phytosanitary measures contribute to those objectives; </li> <li> assisting incountry preparations for CBD, SBSTTA, Cartagena Protocol and related activities. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Recommendation(s) superseded by the above</strong> : </p> <p> None </p><br clear=\"all\" /> <p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p> <!-- Raw HTML content: [end] --> <!-- CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:2081260/html [end] --> ','80'),(329,'<!-- CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:2081258/html [begin] --> <a id=\"c2081258\"></a> <!-- Raw HTML content: [begin] --> <p> <strong>Background</strong> : </p> <p> This Recommendation was adopted at CPM-1 in 2006 (see report of CPM-1, paragraph 152 &amp; Appendix XVIII).

There can be only one contact point per contracting party. The contracting party, by making the nomination, agrees that the nominee has the necessary authority to fulfil the functions of the contact point as determined within the framework of the IPPC.

With the overall aim of reducing release of methyl bromide into the atmosphere, NPPOs may consider methods of reducing the quantities of methyl bromide used, reducing methyl bromide emissions by physical means, and promoting and implementing phytosanitary measures that are economically and technically feasible as viable alternatives to the use of methyl bromide. The IPPC Recommendation also provides guidance on recording the use of methyl bromide. </p><strong><br clear=\"all\" /></strong> <p> <strong>Background</strong> </p> <p> The main purpose of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the responsibility of its contracting parties is to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products and to promote appropriate measures for their control. In doing so, contracting parties also undertake the promotion of appropriate measures for the control of regulated pests. In its preamble, the IPPC states that in agreeing to the Convention, contracting parties take into account \"internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human and animal health, and the environment\". The second meeting of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM) \"Encouraged contracting parties to promote best fumigation practices, recapture technology and development and use of alternatives to methyl bromide in phytosanitary measures where this was technically and economically feasible\". Thus, while pursuing the IPPC^s purpose, contracting parties are also encouraged to take into account environmental concerns, among which is protection of the ozone layer by reducing methyl bromide emissions. </p> <p> IPPC contracting parties may also be party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Signatories to the Montreal Protocol are obliged to protect the ozone layer by reducing, and ultimately eliminating, emissions of ozone-depleting substances through a phase-out of production and import and consumption of such substances, noting the quarantine and pre-shipment (QPS) <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[2]</ins></a> exemptions. </p> <p> In the 1992 Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, methyl bromide was listed as an ozone-depleting substance subject to phase-out provisions of the Montreal Protocol. However, the use of methyl bromide for QPS purposes is currently exempt from the protocol^s phase-out provisions because of difficulties in identifying technically and economically feasible alternatives. There is currently no limit on the amount of methyl bromide that can be used for these QPS purposes. In 1999, in the Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, mandatory requirements for the provision of statistical data on amounts of methyl bromide used annually for QPS purposes were agreed to. This amendment entered into force in January 2001. Therefore, parties to the Montreal Protocol already have obligations to monitor and report their use of methyl bromide for QPS applications. </p> <p> Methyl bromide has been widely used as a pest control treatment for many decades. It offers a broad spectrum of control for insects, nematodes, weeds, pathogens and rodents. Methyl bromide has been employed primarily as a soil fumigant before planting crops, and is also used for commodity treatment and structural fumigation. Most uses of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure are for the treatment of durable commodities, such as grains, cereals and dried foodstuffs, wood packaging materials, wood and logs, as well as perishable commodities, such as fruit. </p> <p> It is recognized that alternatives to methyl bromide for use as phytosanitary measures are needed, particularly because there may be future restrictions on the use of methyl bromide. It is also recognized that there is a need for contracting parties to continue to use methyl bromide until equivalent and feasible alternative phytosanitary measures are available. </p> <p> Some countries have already successfully reduced or eliminated the use of methyl bromide. </p> <p> To be considered viable under the IPPC, phytosanitary measures that are alternatives to methyl bromide and that are equivalent to methyl bromide fumigation as per ISPM No. 24 ( <em>Guidelines for the determination and recognition of equivalence of phytosanitary measures</em> ) should also be economically and technically feasible. In comparison, the United Nations Environment Programme^s Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee defined alternatives as \"those non-chemical or chemical treatments and/or procedures that are technically feasible for controlling pests, thus avoiding or replacing the use of methyl bromide\". <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[3]</ins></a> </p> <p> <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong> </p> <p> To reduce the risk of introduction of some quarantine pests, the need for methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure remains until a range of equivalent alternatives has been developed. Contracting parties are encouraged to put in place a strategy that will help them to reduce the use of methyl bromide for phytosanitary measures and/or reduce emissions of methyl bromide. This may include the following areas for action: </p> <ul> <li> replacing methyl bromide use </li> <li> reducing methyl bromide use </li> <li> physically reducing methyl bromide emissions </li> <li> accurately recording methyl bromide use for phytosanitary measures. </li> </ul> <p> In developing and implementing strategies to replace and/or reduce methyl bromide use and reduce emissions, contracting parties should also take into account any international obligations to which they may be subject and relevant IPPC principles. These principles are described in ISPM No. 1 (<em>Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary measures in international trade</em>). </p> <p> <strong>1. Replacement of Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> In recognition of the desire to minimize the use of methyl bromide, contracting parties should, where possible, take actions to replace methyl bromide usage by increasing the application of alternative phytosanitary measures. Where methyl bromide fumigation is currently used as a phytosanitary treatment for regulated pests it may be replaced by an alternative phytosanitary measure in which no methyl bromide is used. This may involve the implementation of systems approaches, pest free areas (PFAs), areas of low pest prevalence (ALPPs), pest free places of production, pest free production sites and equivalence. </p> <p> The following are examples of phytosanitary measures that may be implemented independently or in conjunction with other phytosanitary measures to replace methyl bromide as a phytosanitary treatment when equivalent: </p> <ul> <li> use of other chemicals such as treatments mentioned in Appendix 1 (e.g. sulfuryl fluoride) </li> <li> application of physical treatments (e.g. heating, cooling, irradiation) </li> <li> immediate commodity processing (e.g. grain being milled into flour on arrival) </li> <li> methods of production (e.g. soil-free growing media, tissue culture, sterile culture). </li> </ul> <p> In situations where consignments are identified as non-compliant at the point of import, the use of methyl bromide should be avoided where possible (appropriate actions to be taken in the case of non-compliance are described in section 5.1.6.1 of ISPM No. 20: <em>Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system</em> ). </p> <p> The CPM, largely through the provisions of ISPM No. 28 (<em>Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests</em>), is actively pursuing adoption of treatments that are viable alternatives to methyl bromide. As these alternatives become recognized, contracting parties are encouraged to use them in place of methyl bromide, where appropriate. </p> <p> Where an ISPM contains options for various treatments for a commodity, and one of the options is methyl bromide (currently the only ISPM for which this is the case is ISPM No. 15: <em>Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade</em>) and others are considered to present less of an adverse environmental impact, parties are encouraged to use the lower-impact option(s). </p> <p> Appendix 1 contains a list of articles that have historically been treated with methyl bromide and presents possible alternative phytosanitary treatments that could be used to replace or reduce the use of methyl bromide. </p> <p> <strong>2. Reducing Volumes of Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> The reduction of methyl bromide emissions can be achieved through the use of reduced dosages of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure or decreased treatment frequency. In addition, existing methyl bromide use should be analysed carefully to determine if the treatment is appropriate and necessary. </p> <p> The following approaches may, where appropriate, be pursued to reduce the use of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure: </p> <ul> <li> inspection-based fumigation instead of mandatory fumigation (i.e. to detect and identify the quarantine pest of concern ) </li> <li> avoidance of unjustified re-fumigation with methyl bromide (i.e. re-fumigation should be used only when a quarantine pest situation is evident) </li> <li> improvement of treatment facilities as appropriate to maximize efficiency of fumigation, thus reducing replenishment or re-fumigation requirements </li> <li> increasing exposure time with a view to reducing dosage, where technically feasible </li> <li> compliance with phytosanitary requirements for exporting commodities </li> <li> avoidance of application in situations where efficacy is doubtful or marginal </li> <li> re assessment of doses and exposure times in order to reduce them </li> <li> use of optimal temperatures when fumigating </li> <li> use of appropriately sized treatment facilities </li> <li> evaluation of pest risk and treatment efficacy (through a pest risk analysis) to determine if a more appropriate dose or alternative treatment is possible. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>3. Physically Reducing Methyl Bromide Emissions</strong> </p> <p> Contracting parties should aim to minimize or eliminate the release of methyl bromide to the atmosphere by physical means. This may be achieved by upgrading facilities as appropriate to increase efficiency of methyl bromide application to improve: </p> <ul> <li> methyl bromide emissions control, e.g. by recapture, and/or reuse or destruction, through the use of leak-proof chambers and containment/capture bubbles, etc. </li> <li> fumigation performance, e.g. by use of bioassay controls where appropriate in lieu of concentration ? time products, use of higher temperatures during fumigation through supplemental heat when necessary combined with air circulation, pressure testing etc., reduction of leakage </li> <li> gas circulation, e.g. by use of a carrier gas such as CO<sub>2</sub> </li> <li> gas and temperature monitoring including proper calibration of equipment. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>4. Recording Methyl Bromide Use as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> To measure progress in reduction of methyl bromide emissions arising from use of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure, NPPOs are encouraged to accurately record and collate data on current usage and share this data with their country^s National Ozone Unit <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[4]</ins></a> ( the national body responsible for the implementation of the Montreal Protocol). </p> <p> The information on methyl bromide use for phytosanitary measures should contain: </p> <ul> <li> quantities of methyl bromide used in kilograms </li> <li> description of the articles <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[5]</ins></a> fumigated where appropriate </li> <li> whether the use was on import or export commodities </li> <li> target pests. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>5. Guidelines for Appropriate Use of Methyl Bromide as a Phytosanitary Measure</strong> </p> <p> NPPOs are encouraged to be involved in the coordination of the following actions: </p> <p> 1. Review and consider how to change phytosanitary policies (e.g. phytosanitary import requirements) to replace and/or reduce methyl bromide where it is required and where an equivalent, technically feasible, practical and economically viable alternative exists. This may also require review and revision of bilateral agreements between countries. </p> <p> 2. Ensure that methyl bromide fumigation is used only for quarantine pests and that it is authorized or performed by the NPPO, including fumigation as emergency action for pests not previously assessed (as described in section 5.1.6.2 of ISPM No. 20: <em>Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system</em>). </p> <p> 3. Provide guidance to those responsible for methyl bromide fumigations for quarantine purposes on the importance of pursuing feasible alternative phytosanitary measures. </p> <p> 4. Develop and utilize phytosanitary measures that are equivalent, viable and feasible alternatives to methyl bromide. </p> <p> 5. Communicate to other NPPOs where there are viable alternatives to methyl bromide use. </p> <p> 6. Submit phytosanitary treatments that are effective, efficacious, documented, feasible and applicable alternatives to the use of methyl bromide to the IPPC Secretariat using the guidelines in ISPM No. 28 (<em>Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests</em>). </p> <p> 7. Give highest priority to the development of alternative treatments for those commodities for which methyl bromide usage is high. </p> <p> 8. Liaise with research groups and funding bodies to develop alternative treatments as appropriate. </p> <p> 9. Coordinate with the National Ozone Unit, as appropriate, to facilitate the annual collection and reporting of methyl bromide usage data. </p> <p> 10. Post or link details of NPPO-approved alternatives for methyl bromide treatment on the International Phytosanitary Portal (<a href=\"https://www.ippc.int/\">https://www.ippc.int</a>) for exchange of information. </p> <p> 11. Cooperate with the National Ozone Unit to implement a strategy to replace and reduce methyl bromide usage. </p> <p> 12. Exchange information on alternatives to methyl bromide usage between the NPPO and the National Ozone Unit. </p> <p> 13. Identify current treatments where methyl bromide is the only option, and provide sufficient information to the appropriate IPPC body for consideration in the development of potential viable alternatives ( e.g. identify the commodity, pests associated with it for which methyl bromide is used, required efficacy). </p> <p> 14. Evaluate or re-evaluate pest risk (via pest risk analysis) to determine if the treatment prescription is appropriate and whether less rigorous treatment or alternative measures may be used. </p> <p> <strong>Recommendation(s) superseded by the above</strong> : </p> <p> CPM Recommendation ICPM-5/1 </p><strong><br clear=\"all\" /></strong> <p align=\"right\"> <strong>APPENDIX 1</strong> </p> <p align=\"center\"> <strong>EXAMPLES OF potential PHYTOSANITARY TREATMENTS TO REPLACE<br /> OR REDUCE METHYL BROMIDE</strong> </p> <p> Listed in the table below are treatments that may be considered and validated as alternatives to methyl bromide and that are currently registered, where necessary, and used in at least one country <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\"><ins cite=\"mailto:Yukio\" datetime=\"2011-02-27T13:20\">[6]</ins></a> .

The IPPC Business Plan 2007 - 2011, adopted at CPM-2 (2007), identified marine and other aquatic plants as an emerging issue to be considered, and it was stated that ISPMs should be developed or modified to take aquatic invasive plants into account.</p><p>At CPM-5 (2010) a scientific session on aquatic plants was held, outlining the pest risks to and from aquatic plants. CPM members agreed that in principle aquatic plants were covered under the scope of the IPPC.</p><p>At CPM-6 (2011) it was agreed that the issue of aquatic plants (including the question on algae) under the IPPC should be further considered by the Bureau and SPTA and the conclusions be reported back to the CPM (CPM-6, Report, Para 193).</p><p>Accordingly, a &ldquo;Scoping study on aquatic plants and their significance to the IPPC&rdquo; was conducted under the Implementation Review and Support System (IRSS) project and presented at the IPPC Symposium at CPM-7 (2012).</p><p>This recommendation synthesizes these discussions, taking into account the findings from the IRSS study and concludes with a set of recommended actions for contracting parties (including NPPOs), RPPOs and the Secretariat.</p><h1 align=\"left\">Addressed to:</h1><p>Contracting parties, National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs), Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPOs) and the IPPC Secretariat.</p><h1 align=\"left\">Recommendation:</h1><ol><li>The CPM <em>confirms</em> that aquatic plants should be protected and invasive aquatic plants considered as potential pests under the IPPC framework.</li><li>Therefore:</li></ol><h2 align=\"left\">A.

E-commerce is fuelling an increasing volume of traded commodities. In many cases online traders of plants and plant products do not take into account a customer&rsquo;s location before agreeing to a sale and shipping their purchases to them.&nbsp; This lack of knowledge of a customer&rsquo;s location can lead to consignments of regulated articles being imported into a country without the phytosanitary certificates which may be required by the NPPO of that country.</p><p>A number of studies, including an IRSS study on internet trade presented at CPM-7 (2012), have shown that regulated articles ordered over the internet are routinely not accompanied by appropriate phytosanitary certificates during import. Similar concerns have also been identified with other forms of distance selling, such as mail order companies who trade via advertisements in newspapers and magazines.</p><p>In order for the global plant protection framework to keep pace with this, NPPOs, RPPOs and the IPPC Secretariat should collaborate with other stakeholders to monitor internet trade and to ensure that goods ordered in this<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"> way <span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 15.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Akhbar MT&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">comply with </span>relevant </span></span>phytosanitary regulations on the basis of risk analysis.

IPPC members<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> and Technical</p><p>Panels (TPs) submit detailed proposals for new topics or for the revision of existing ISPMs to the IPPC Secretariat. Submissions should be accompanied with a draft specification, a literature review and justification that the proposed topic meets the CPM-approved criteria for topics (available in the IPPC Procedure Manual). To indicate a broader need for the proposed topic, submitters are encouraged to gain support from other IPPC members and/or regions.</p><p>The IPPC Secretariat compiles a list of the proposed topics from the submissions received.</p><p>Submissions from previous years are not included, but IPPC members may re-submit these, as appropriate.</p><p>The Standards Committee (SC), taking into account the IPPC Strategic Framework and the Criteria for justification and prioritization of proposed topics, reviews the existing List of topics for IPPC standards and the compiled list of proposed topics. The SC recommends a revised List of topics for IPPC standards (including subjects), adding topics from the compiled list, deleting or modifying topics in the existing List of topics for IPPC standards as appropriate, giving each topic a recommended priority.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Adjustment and adoption of the list of topics for IPPC standards </strong></p><p>The CPM reviews the List of topics for IPPC standards recommended by the SC. The CPM adjusts and adopts the List of topics for IPPC standards, including assigning a priority for each topic. A revised List of topics for IPPC standards is made available.</p><p>In any year, when a situation arises in which an ISPM is required urgently, the CPM may insert such a topic into the List of topics for IPPC standards.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Stage 2: Drafting</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3: Development of a specification </strong></p><p>&nbsp;The SC should be encouraged to assign a lead steward and one or two assistants for each topic. These assistants could be from outside the SC, such as potential SC replacement members, former SC members, TP members or expert working group members.</p><p>The SC reviews the draft specification. The SC should endeavour to approve draft specifications for member consultation at the SC meeting following the CPM meeting when new topics have been added to the List of topics for IPPC standards.</p><p>Once the SC approves the draft specification for member consultation, the Secretariat makes it publicly available and notifies IPPC members. The length of member consultation for draft specifications is 60 days. The IPPC contact point submits comments to the Secretariat using the OCS.</p><p>The Secretariat compiles the comments received, makes them publicly available and submits them to the steward(s) and SC for consideration. The specification is revised and approved by the SC and made publicly available.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Preparation of a draft ISPM3<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><strong>[3]</strong></a> </strong></p><p>An expert drafting group (EDG, expert working group (EWG) or TP) drafts or revises the draft ISPM in accordance with the relevant specification. The resulting draft ISPM is recommended to the SC.</p><p>The SC or SC-7 reviews the draft ISPM at a meeting (for a Diagnostic Protocol (DP) or</p><p>Phytosanitary Treatment (PT), the SC reviews it electronically) and decides whether to approve it for member consultation, to return it to the steward(s) or an EDG or to put it on hold. When the SC-7 meets, comments from any SC members should be taken into account.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Stage 3: Member consultation for draft ISPMs</strong></p><p><strong>Step 5: Member consultation for draft ISPMs</strong></p><p>Once the SC approves the draft ISPM for member consultation, the Secretariat makes it publicly available and notifies IPPC members. The length of member consultation for draft ISPMs is 150 days. The IPPC contact point submits comments to the Secretariat using the OCS.</p><p>The Secretariat compiles the comments received, makes them publicly available and submits them to the steward(s) for consideration. The steward(s) reviews the comments, prepares responses to the comments, revises the draft ISPM and submits them to the Secretariat. These are made available to the SC.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Review of the draft ISPM prior to the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures meeting</strong></p><p>Taking the comments into account, the SC-7 or TP (for DPs or PTs) revises the draft ISPM and recommends the draft ISPM to the SC.</p><p>Once the SC-7 or TP recommends the draft ISPM to the SC, the Secretariat makes it available to IPPC members for the substantial concerns commenting period and notifies IPPC members. The length of the substantial concerns commenting period for draft ISPMs is 120 days and should focus their comments on substantial concerns. The IPPC contact point submits the comments to the Secretariat using the OCS. The SC members should review comments submitted from their region and identify the comments deemed to be most important to the steward(s), accompanied by suggestions on how to address them.</p><p>The steward(s) reviews the comments, prepares responses to the comments, revises the draft ISPM and submits them to the Secretariat. These are made available to the SC and the draft ISPM is made available to IPPC members.</p><p>The SC reviews the comments, the steward(s)&rsquo; responses to the comments and the revised draft ISPM. The SC provides a summary of the major issues discussed by the SC for the draft ISPM. These summaries are recorded in the report of the SC meeting. The SC decides whether to recommend the draft ISPM to the CPM, or to put it on hold, return it to the steward(s) or an EDG or submit it for another round of member consultation.</p><p>The Secretariat should make the draft ISPM available in the languages of the organization as soon as possible and at least six weeks prior to the opening of the CPM meeting.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Stage 4: Adoption and publication</strong></p><p><strong>Step 7: Adoption </strong></p><p>Following approval by the SC, the draft ISPM is included on the agenda of the CPM meeting.</p><p>All draft ISPMs presented to the CPM are subject to a formal objection<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>. If a contracting party (CP) has a formal objection, the CP submits the formal objection along with the technical justification and suggestions for improvement of the draft ISPM to the Secretariat no later than 14 days prior to the CPM meeting and the draft ISPM should be returned to the SC. If no formal objection is received, the CPM should adopt the ISPM without discussion. In exceptional circumstances, not including DPs and PTs, there should be an opportunity for the</p><p>CPM Chair, in consultation with the SC Chair and the Secretariat, to propose a discussion of the formal objection at the CPM meeting with the aim that the formal objection can be lifted and the ISPM be adopted.</p><p>If the draft ISPM had been previously included on the agenda of the CPM and was subjected to a formal objection, the SC may decide to forward the draft ISPM to the CPM for a vote with no option for a formal objection.</p><p>For DPs, the CPM has delegated its authority to the SC to adopt DPs on its behalf. Once the SC approves the DP, the Secretariat makes it available and CPs are notified<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>. The notification period for approved DPs is twice a year on defined dates. CPs have 45 days to review the approved DP and submit a formal objection, if any. If no formal objection is received, the SC, on behalf of the CPM, adopts the DP. DPs adopted through this process are noted by the CPM and attached to the report of the CPM meeting.</p><p>When a technical revision is required for an adopted DP, the SC can adopt the updates to adopted DPs via electronic means.

It takes into consideration both direct and indirect damage by pests, so it includes weeds. It also covers vehicles, aircraft and vessels, containers, storage places, soil and other objects or material that can harbour or spread pests. \r\n\r\nThe Convention provides a framework and a forum for international cooperation, harmonization and technical exchange between contracting parties. \r\n\r\nIts implementation involves collaboration by National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs) ? the official services established by governments to discharge the functions specified by the IPPC ? and Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPOs), which can act as coordinating bodies at a regional level to achieve the objectives of the IPPC. \r\n\r\nThe convention has been deposited with the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) since its adoption in 1951.','54'),(345,'[International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs)](/standards) are the standards adopted by the [Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM)](/core-activities/governance/cpm), which is the governing body of the IPPC.

Several background documents on sea containers (documents on the biosecurity risk and its management, examples of management programs, pest risk assessment of insects in sea cargo containers, etc...) that were provided by some NPPOs are also available through this [link](https://www.ippc.int/node/27777)** ## 2014-04 CPM-9 (2014) decisions on the topic Minimizing pest movement by sea containers (2008-001) **CPM-9 (2014) agreed to the following statement:** \"The CPM: - recognised and appreciated the **joint initiative by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) of revising the Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units (CTU Code)**. With the support from the IPPC Expert Working Group on Sea Containers, those organizations have incorporated into the revised CTU Code several elements of phytosanitary relevance, e.g. information on pests and other contamination which may be associated with CTUs, as well as very useful practical guidelines for cleanliness, cleaning, packing and handling; - welcomed the [recent adoption of the CTU Code by UNECE](http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=35067) and looked forward to the adoption also by IMO and ILO of the revised CTU Code later this year; - emphasised that the careful implementation of the revised CTU Code by all operators responsible for and involved in the packing and handling of sea containers is crucial for preventing the spread of pests and invasive alien species.\" THe CPM also also: - noted that the SC will discuss the comments from member consultation and how to proceed with the development of the ISPM on Minimizing pest movement by sea containers (2008-001), including the possible need for further survey work; - encouraged contracting parties and the IPPC Secretariat to liaise with national and international counterparts respectively to express their appreciation for the work done by IMO/ILO/UNECE and seek further collaboration; and - requested the Secretariat in association with the EU, USA, Japan, Argentina and Gabon to prepare a draft recommendation for possible adoption at CPM-10 - requested the Secretary to send the statements above to the heads of IMO, ILO and UNECE. ##2014-02 Draft industry guidance - IMO/ILO/UNECE Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units (CTU Code) - endorsed by UNECE As mentioned below in the section regarding the 2012 May Expert Working Group (EWG) meeting, industry guidance in the form of a Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units has been updated jointly by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). The Sea Containers EWG provided input into this guidance so it could include phytosanitary requirements for cleaning sea containers. The [January 2014 version of the Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units (CTUs)](http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2014/itc/id_07_CTU_Code_January_2014.pdf) is posted below for information (not open for commenting). It has been endorsed by the [Inland Transport Committee (25 to 27 February 2014) of the UNECE]((http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=35067)). It will be presented later to IMO and ILO. The specific parts of interest are chapter 3, chapter 4 (section 4.2.10), chapter 8 (sections 8.2.4.4, 8.3.2.4 and 8.3.2.5) and Annex 13. ## 2013-12 Compiled comments on the 2013 member consultation The IPPC Secretariat compiled the comments received during the 2013 member consultation on the preliminary draft standard on sea containers and sent them to the steward. The compiled comments are available by clicking [this link](https://www.ippc.int/publications/2013-compiled-comments-draft-ispm-minimizing-pest-movement-sea-containers-2008-001). They will be considered in detail by the Standards Committee in their 2014 May meeting. ## 2013-11 SC discussion and decisions (See meeting report posted below: section 4.1) An update was given by the subgroup of the SC who had been charged, in the 2013 May SC meeting, with developing a survey for NPPOs on the rate of pest interceptions on sea containers and an accompanying letter. This SC subgroup had completed their tasks but had also requested the support of two statisticians from the USA and New Zealand. The statisticians had noted difficulties with conducting such surveys. In order to yield acceptable results that could be repeated in the future, the surveys would need to be done with the proper methodology and this could be expensive and time consuming. The SC survey group had suggested that statisticians analyse data from previous surveys from several countries (China, USA, Australia and New Zealand) and further consider if a new survey would be needed. The SC agreed that the statisticians? opinions should be carefully considered by the SC survey group before making a recommendation to CPM on whether a survey should be done. The preliminary draft ISPM on Minimizing pest movement by sea containers (2008-001) had been sent for member consultation through the OCS (1 July ? 1 December 2013): draft ISPM posted below. The SC noted that all comments on the preliminary draft ISPM will be considered during the May 2014 SC meeting (as opposed to the regular process where the SC-7 reviews member comments). The SC agreed to present an update on activities related to sea containers to CPM-9 (2014), to be prepared by the SC subgroup. ## 2013-05 SC discussion and decisions: (See meeting report posted below: sections 3.1 and 5.2) As requested by CPM-8 (2013), the SC approved for member consultation the revised preliminary draft on Minimizing pest movement by sea containers (2008-001), with the understanding that there will be a further member consultation. The SC decided that this preliminary draft would be open only for general conceptual comments on sections of text. The length of the 2013 member consultation for draft ISPMs is 150 days (1 July 2013 to 1 December 2013). ## The topic was also discussed in the following meetings: -**2013-04 CPM-8 (2013)**: see decisions in section 8.1.4 of the meeting report posted below - **2012-11 Standards Committee (SC) November 2012** (see meeting report &quot;2012-11 Report of the Standards Committee&quot;, paragraph 132 to 153) - **2012-11 Standards Committee (SC) meeting** (See 2012 November SC meeting report posted below, paragraph 132 to 153) - **2012-10 Strategic Planning Group (SPG) meeting** (see meeting report &quot;2012-10 SPG 14 REPORT&quot;, paragraph 36 to 43) - **2012-05 Expert Working Group (EWG) meeting in Malaysia** (see meeting report, &quot;2012 Report: EWG on Minimizing Pest Movement by Sea Containers (May, 2012)&quot;) - **2012-04 SC April 2012** (see meeting report, &quot;2012-04 Report of the Standards Committee&quot;) - **2012-03 CPM-7 (2012) decision and side event** (see meeting report, &quot;CPM-7 REPORT (2012)&quot; and presentation given at the side event, &quot;Presentation to CPM 7&quot;) - **2011-11 Steering Committee on Sea Containers (SCSC) Meeting Rome** (see meeting report below, &quot;2011 Report: Meeting of the Steering Committee on Sea Containers&quot;) - **2011-03 SC selected experts for Expert Working Group (EWG)** - **2010-04 SC approved Specification 51** (see link below, &quot;Specification 51: Minimizing pest movement by sea containers and conveyances in international trade&quot;) - **2010-03 CPM-5** recommended this topic be worked on as a matter of urgency - **2009-11 Standards Committee (SC)** approved draft specification for MC - **2008-03 Third meeting of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM-3)** added topic Minimizing pest movement by sea containers and conveyances (2008-001) to the List of Topics for IPPC standards. <p class=\"warning floatcenter\">This web page was last updated on 2014-04-22 by C?line Germain.

A wider consultation of experts on draft protocols in earlier stages of development is crucial to ensure the quality of the protocol and to facilitate the adoption process. </p> <p><strong>Process:</strong> IPPC diagnostic protocols are under development in the framework of <a href=\"https://www.ippc.int/publications/diagnostic-protocols-regulated-pests\">ISPM 27: 2006 (Diagnostic protocols for regulated pests)</a>.The protocols are developed by a main author with support from a few experts and together make up Diagnostic Protocol (DP) drafting group. An expert group, the <a href=\"https://www.ippc.int/core-activities/standards-setting/expert-drafting-groups/technical-panels/technical-panel-diagnostic-protocols\">Technical Panel on Diagnostic Protocols</a>, ensures that draft texts meet the requirements set for IPPC diagnostic protocols.

They contain the minimum requirements for reliable diagnosis of the specified regulated pests, and provide flexibility to ensure that methods are appropriate for use in the full range of circumstances for which a diagnostic protocol may be used (e.g. from detection of a pest in a consignment, to surveillance, to routine diagnosis). Only methods of relevance for diagnostics are given in the protocol. The methods included in diagnostic protocols are selected on the basis of their sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Information related to these factors is provided for each of these methods. </p> In order to achieve high quality of IPPC diagnostic protocols, we are seeking expert input on the protocols listed below. <p class=\"warning floatcenter\"> For information on the Expert Consultation process, please email to <a href=\"mailto:ippc-dp@fao.org\">ippc-dp@fao.org.</a> </p>*This web page was last updated on 2014-04-17 by Adriana Moreira.

Most of the work is done in English and most of the reference documents are in English, and translating the DPs before adoption has a great cost. The proposal was to develop these DPs in English and translate into languages after adoption. Some members, although they empathized with non-English speakers, supported the development of DPs in English to save time and financial resources. However, some other members, while understanding the reasons for the proposal, suggested that the translation should continue to ensure that all technical experts have access to the DPs. The CPM agreed that DPs be translated at two stages: before member consultation, upon request by an IPPC member, for translation into official FAO languages; and as normal, prior to the adoption of the DP by CPM. The CPM requested the Secretariat to provide a mechanism for requests for translation of DPs into FAO languages before member consultation (available below). <p class=\"warning floatcenter\">This web page was last updated on 2013-06-19 by Adriana Moreira.

The request forms are collated by the Secretariat and sent to the TPPT for review. The requests are analysed by the TPPT and used to recommend the priority areas for development of phytosanitary treatments as ISPMs. The recommendations are made taking into account the criteria for prioritization of phytosanitary treatments. In the absence of clear guidance, the TPPT will determine priority areas. Within a treatment area or type (such as treatments for fruit flies, or hot water treatments), the TPPT may also decide priorities for production of ISPMs (based on a list of possible treatments). The TPPT will also take into account recommendations by other Commission bodies. **Call for treatment submissions** Once the priority treatment areas/types (and, if appropriate the specific treatments within these areas/types) have been identified by the TPPT, the Secretariat issues a call for submissions of data for these treatments (e.g. fruit flies, irradiation, soil and growing media, wood packaging material treatments). Guidance on the information to be contained in these submissions is provided in ISPM 28:2007 Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests.</p><p class=\"warning floatcenter\">This web page was last updated on 2014-01-24.

It is a requirement that parties first consult bilaterally with the aim of resolving the problem before initiating any formal processes.\r\n\r\nIf further action is needed, the disputing parties can ask the Director-General of FAO to form an expert panel to review the situation and recommend a course of action. While the outcomes of any dispute settlement provided by the IPPC are not legally binding, the process and results will likely have significant weight if the issue is taken to the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the SPS Agreement, particularly if the issue is related to the use of international standards (ISPMs) under the IPPC.\r\n\r\nThe IPPC also provides technical support to the WTO dispute settlement process and helps identify experts for WTO panels evaluating technical phytosanitary issues. WTO dispute settlements are legally binding and can have serious economic and political consequences. Therefore, the IPPC encourages governments to begin with technical consultation with the aim of dispute avoidance.\r\n\r\nIn some cases technical assistance from FAO can provide the basis for resolution; in other cases the IPPC Secretariat can facilitate consultations or help disputing parties to identify suitable alternatives for resolution.

The PCE allows for the prioritization of activities/resources to fill capacity gaps and enhance the effectiveness of the overall phytosanitary system. Strategic plans developed through the PCE also provides the basis for dialogue with donors of development aid and thus improve the likelihood of access to further funding.\r\n\r\n**How is the PCE Applied?**\r\n\r\nThe entire PCE process is under the control of the country â€“ it is not something that is done TO a country, it is a framework that the country adopts for its own purposes and benefits.\r\n\r\nThe PCE is a modular online software system consisting of 13 semi structured questionnaire type modules that can be selected and applied in total or in clusters according to the preferences of the national plant protection organization (NPPO).\r\n\r\nThe process is implemented through a consensus driven and confidential process amongst concerned stakeholders (public and private) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the phytosanitary system. The PCE contains strategic planning tools that guide users to develop a strategic framework consisting of logical frameworks for each module which together are used to develop a national phytosanitary action plan (NPAP).\r\n\r\nThe results are intended to be used by NPPOs, and more broadly by government agencies, as a basis to identify capacity building or infrastructure needs and actions to address them. These are not publicly released unless a country wishes to use or present their PCE results externally. The PCE is designed to be implemented at a pace defined by the country over a number of weeks. The IPPC recommends that a complete PCE be applied every 3-4 years.\r\n\r\n**Who Should Be Involved in Conducting a PCE?**\r\n\r\nThe process is driven by staff of the NPPO but should involve non-NPPO representatives from appropriate government agencies, research institutes, universities, agro-industries or import/export associations, etc. The IPPC recommends involvement of a knowledgeable and experienced facilitator.\r\n\r\n**When Should a PCE be Applied?**\r\n\r\nThe PCE can be applied in total or in parts and as frequently as needed. It is a good compliment to the national planning process of the NPPO. When seeking external funds for phytosanitary development it is recommended that the project be formulated on the basis of the results of the PCE.\r\n\r\n**How is a PCE Financed?**\r\n\r\nSome contracting parties are capable of financing the process unilaterally, e.g. from the national budget. In other situations, donors may pay for the application of the PCE. The IPPC does not fund the application of a PCE but works in close collaboration with donors to provide the support for the application of a PCE when requested. In all cases some counterpart resources should be considered and allocated at the na tional level to undertake planning, stakeholder identification and resource allocation for workshops to support and ensure that the PCE process is successfully completed.\r\n\r\n**For more information:**\r\n\r\nDownload the PDF files below\r\nContact the IPPC Secretariat','436'),(432,'**Building National Phytosanitary Capacity**\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Phytosanitary Measures at its third session (CPM-3) tasked the Secretariat with developing a common strategy for contracting parties and its partners to build national phytosanitary capacity.

For more information about reporting, see the [Convention][4] and the reports of the sessions of the [Commission&nbsp;on Phytosanitary Measures][5]\r\nSharing information about your pest status, phytosanitary measures, regulations and other information is vital to the future of the world^s plant resources and biodiversity, to safe trade in plants and plant products, and to food security.\r\nSharing information on regulations, pest outbreaks, control, surveillance and treatments builds cooperation and enhances member countries^ capacity to protect their plant resources. Countries use this information to assess the risks associated with moving plants and plant products across borders, and to manage those risks wisely.\r\n\r\nInformation exchange supports transparency and risk analysis by:\r\n\r\n- promoting the control of pests and preventing their spread\r\n- sharing technical information on which to base decisions\r\n- using international standards\r\n- promoting the harmonization of phytosanitary measures; and\r\n- meeting the public information requirements of the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Secretariat uses the information provided by member countries to coordinate the IPPC work programme, to review the state of plant protection around the world, to help in dispute avoidance and to inform CPM decisions.

In such cases, the Secretariat may note these provisions in response to individual requests. Examples of these types of questions are provided below.\r\nFor other questions, however, the standard does not appear to provide explicit guidance and issues of interpretation are raised. In this regard, it is emphasized that contracting parties, not the Secretariat, have the responsibility to interpret and implement the standard. Accordingly, while the Secretariat may in some cases identify factors for consideration based on the standard, it is up to the parties to determine whether they are in compliance with the standard. Input from the Secretariat should not be regarded as an official legal interpretation. Consistent with this, commercial users of this standard should contact the National Plant Protection Organization in their country to resolve questions that they might have.\r\nParts 4 - 9 below also provide information on other questions of a practical nature that have been put to the Secretariat regarding the implementation of ISPM No. 15.','9142'),(786,'International Forestry Quarantine Research Group - 2013 - 11th Meeting work area','26756'),(787,'<p/>','28120'),(788,'This is a work area set up for the Invasive Species Liaison Group.

The objective is to provide a single portal to official phytosanitary information and to facilitate IPPC contracting parties to meet their reporting obligations under the IPPC.\r\n\r\nNational data can be entered into the IPP by the Official Contact Point. IPPC Contact Points can also nominate IPP editors to undertake data entry on their behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>I am the IPPC contact point for a country.

How do I do this?</b>\r\n\r\nA section at the bottom of all forms for national reporting enables IPPC Contact Points and Editors to directly notify selected recipients whenever they make changes or additions to their NPPO page. \r\n\r\nPotential recipients of these notifications include the IPPC Official Contact Point for trading partner nations, representatives of RPPOs, and the IPPC Secretariat. Once selected, recipients will automatically receive an email notifying them when a change has been made to the NPPO webpage along with a link to the part of the NPPO page that has been modified.  In this way, the selected recipients are made aware of updates to contact information, the addition of pest reports, the publication of phytosanitary regulations, etc, and this is more consistent with the reporting requirements of the IPPC.\r\n\r\nTo use the Notification tool, please follow these steps: \r\n1. Login to the IPP.\r\n\r\n2. Open the form to add or update information.\r\n\r\n3. At the bottom of the form is a section labelled the “Notifications Tool”\r\n\r\nIf you wish to notify others of the availability of new information, you must select recipients the first time you use the notification tool. Your selection will then be saved as your default recipient list.\r\nOnce you have selected your default recipient list, to send out notifications in the future you can select Yes, send to default recipients.\r\nIf you do not want to notify others of changes, select No, submit without notification.\r\n4.

At CPM-8, New Zealand presented a proposal for focusing more on broadening work on implementation of the IPPC and ISPMs and establishing a CPM-directed implementation programme.\r\n\r\nSince CPM-8 (2013) discussions have been held in the Bureau and SPG meetings to consider this new focus of work. The CPM-9 agreed to strengthen the focus on implementation, recognizing that this will require strong commitment from each CPM member and the Secretariat, as well as additional financial resources.\r\n\r\nBased on CP feedback a terms of reference (ToR) for an Open Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Implementation has been prepared. The objective is to establish the required mechanisms to focus on implementation, and ensure the work of the Secretariat staff and CPM bodies are able to be coordinated and work together to deliver a coherent programme of work.\r\n\r\nThe OEWG is also tasked to develop and define the scope of a pilot work plan to implement ISPM 6:1997(Guidelines for surveillance) (2009-004) and to submit a strategic work plan to CPM-10 (2015) for approval.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the OEWG will be shared with the SPG, subsidiary bodies and the CDC as necessary, and a report back to CPM-10 (2015) will be made. \r\n\r\nDocument 1 \"OEWG Implementation meeting preparation form\" is provided for participants to prepare for the meeting.

EU legislation on plant health is implemented through national legislation in each of the Member States. The EU Plant Health Regime is administered by the Plant Health Unit of the Health and Consumers Directorate-General (DG SANCO) of the European Commission. They are responsible for developing, adapting and proposing new legislation and organising and chairing regular meetings of the Standing Committee of Plant Health with the Member States. The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of DG SANCO are responsible for ensuring that EU plant health standards are complied with by member states and by third countries who export to the EU. They do this through the collation of survey data and carrying out inspections in member states and third countries. The FVO also manage Europhyt - a notification and rapid alert system for plant health interceptions made on consignments of plants and plant products imported into the EU or traded within the EU.

Member States are required to regulate the movement of plants or plant products within their territory and to regulate the introduction of plants or plant products into the EU from third countries. Obligations are also placed upon third countries that want to export plants or plant products to the EU. The [Plant Health Directive 2000/29/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&val=236966%3Acs&pos=6&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=6&list=463418%3Acs%2C404014%3Acs%2C284048%3Acs%2C283540%3Acs%2C283539%3Acs%2C236966%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte), supported by a number of Control Directives and Emergency Measures, provides the legislative basis of the Plant Health Regime of the European Union. EU legislation on plant health is implemented through national legislation in each of the Member States. The EU Plant Health Regime is administered by the Plant Health Unit of the Health and Consumers Directorate-General (DG SANCO) of the European Commission. They are responsible for developing, adapting and proposing new legislation and organising and chairing regular meetings of the Standing Committee of Plant Health with the Member States. The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of DG SANCO are responsible for ensuring that EU plant health standards are complied with by member states and by third countries who export to the EU. They do this through the collation of survey data and carrying out inspections in member states and third countries. The FVO also manage Europhyt - a notification and rapid alert system for plant health interceptions made on consignments of plants and plant products imported into the EU or traded within the EU.

With total land area of 92.100 square miles (238,537 square kilometers), Ghana is a blessed land endowed with natural mineral resources such as gold, diamond, timber, cocoa etc. Its population is approximately 18.8 million.\n\nA visitor coming to Ghana can use the following major entry points.\n\nAir: The Kotoka International Airport is the principal air entry point to Ghana. It is a modern airport that places its technological facilities at the disposal of other countries in the West Africa sub-region. This explains why Ghana is referred to as the ³Gateway to Africa².\n\nSea: Ghana boasts of two major ports, the Tema Port in the Greater Accra Region, some nine (9) kilometers south of the capital city, Accra and the Takoradi Port located in the Western Region of the country.\n\nLand: There are three major entry points by land.

Elle se tiendra cette année au Siège de la Commission de l’Union Africaine à Addis-Abeba en Ethiopie. Cette réunion se déroulera du 26 au 28 mars 2008 juste avant celle de la Commission des Mesures Phytosanitaires (CMP) du 07 au 11 avril 2008 à Rome. Le CPI voudrait inviter le représentant du Service National de la Protection des Végétaux de votre pays à participer à cette Assemblée générale. En outre, l’Assemblée générale 2008 promet d’être un cadre de restructuration et de renouvellement institutionnel du CPI-UA où des issues saillantes sur des stratégies futures du CPI seront discutées. Afin d’encourager la participation, le CPI couvrira les charges (ticket de voyage et perdiem) du premier représentant de chaque pays membre. D’ailleurs, cette participation est d’intérêt particulier pour tous les pays africains parce que des décisions stratégiques sur le CMP à Rome y seront discutées. Tout en espérant que votre présence à cette Assemblée Générale permettra si possible l’apparition des activités complémentaires plus fortes entre le CPI-UA et les Etats membres de l’Union Africaine. Nous vous saurions gré de noter qu’un rapport de pays devra être soumis au CPI-UA et au représentant de la CER dont chaque pays est rattaché. Le vôtre vous contactera personnellement très bientôt.

The symbol has a significant impact on many industries and, consequently, on national economies and at the international level.  The symbol, therefore, has great economic value for all, and the potential consequences of failing to protect the ISPM 15 symbol are profound.\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Registration provides the highest level of protection for the symbol, and helps shield countries from trade disruptions and related negative economic impacts.  In addition, registration is a fundamental part of the common effort of FAO and IPPC signatory countries to ensure effective management of the trade in wood packaging material, to prevent the introduction and spread of pests and diseases that are harmful to plant resources worldwide.  Prompt registration will help achieve global ISPM 15 coverage, and ensure phytosanitary security in the global trade system.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Registration through FAO is easy, efficient and convenient for countries because FAO handles all aspects of the registration, as described below.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"ConsequencesNonRegistrationIspm15\">\r\n  <a href=\"#ConsequencesNonRegistrationIspm15\" title=\"Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.\">What are the consequences of non-registration of the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>Failure to register the symbol will undermine the integrity of the entire ISPM 15 system worldwide. The current gaps in registration pose a significant risk from a global plant health perspective, and from legal and commercial standpoints.  The fact that some countries do not ensure proper registration creates a risk of opportunistic or malevolent use of the symbol by third parties, with consequent adverse effects on international trade, national economies, and phytosanitary security.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Legally, registration of the mark provides the most complete protection and gives the most effective legal tools should actions against a third party become necessary.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"WhyFaoOwnership\">\r\n  <a href=\"#WhyFaoOwnership\" title=\"Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.\">Why does FAO own the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>Most national laws require that an entity be entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that any product or service bearing a certification symbol like the ISPM 15 meets the required characteristics.  Consolidated ownership of the symbol in one entity ensures a consistent management and monitoring of the symbol worldwide.</p>\r\n    \r\n  <p>FAO is an impartial guardian and promoter of phytosanitary security and seeks to ensure countries’ common interest in effective and fair use of the symbol.  It is also responsible for administering the IPPC, under which the symbol was developed.  By virtue of its ownership of the symbol, FAO fulfills the functions described above, and protects the symbol’s warranty function, thus helping ensure fairness in international trade.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"WhichCountriesRegister\">\r\n  <a href=\"#WhichCountriesRegister\" title=\"Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.\">Which countries should register the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>Any country where the symbol has not yet been registered should do so.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"HowRegister\">\r\n  <a href=\"#HowRegister\" title=\"Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.\">How does registration of the ISPM 15 symbol work?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>As endorsed by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), the registration will be handled by FAO.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>The CPM has planned that all outstanding registrations should be completed within a period of five years.  During this timeframe, FAO will process individual registrations gradually, in accordance with a set of criteria established by the IPPC Secretariat.

Strategic plans developed through the PCE also provides the basis for dialogue with donors of development aid and thus improve the likelihood of access to further funding.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"applypce\">\r\n  <a href=\"#applypce\">How is the PCE Applied?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>The entire PCE process is under the control of the country â€“ it is not something that is done TO a country, it is a framework that the country adopts for its own purposes and benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The PCE is a modular online software system consisting of 13 semi structured questionnaire type modules that can be selected and applied in total or in clusters according to the preferences of the national plant protection organization (NPPO).</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The process is implemented through a consensus driven and confidential process amongst concerned stakeholders (public and private) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the phytosanitary system. The PCE contains strategic planning tools that guide users to develop a strategic framework consisting of logical frameworks for each module which together are used to develop a national phytosanitary action plan (NPAP).</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The results are intended to be used by NPPOs, and more broadly by government agencies, as a basis to identify capacity building or infrastructure needs and actions to address them. These are not publicly released unless a country wishes to use or present their PCE results externally. The PCE is designed to be implemented at a pace defined by the country over a number of weeks. The IPPC recommends that a complete PCE be applied every 3-4 years.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"whopce\">\r\n  <a href=\"#whopce\">Who Should Be Involved in Conducting a PCE?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>The process is driven by staff of the NPPO but should involve non-NPPO representatives from appropriate government agencies, research institutes, universities, agro-industries or import/export associations, etc. The IPPC recommends involvement of a knowledgeable and experienced facilitator.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"whenpce\">\r\n  <a href=\"#whenpce\">When Should a PCE be Applied?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>The PCE can be applied in total or in parts and as frequently as needed. It is a good compliment to the national planning process of the NPPO. When seeking external funds for phytosanitary development it is recommended that the project be formulated on the basis of the results of the PCE.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"faqq\" id=\"financepce\">\r\n  <a href=\"#financepce\">How is a PCE Financed?</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n  <p>Some contracting parties are capable of financing the process unilaterally, e.g. from the national budget. In other situations, donors may pay for the application of the PCE. The IPPC does not fund the application of a PCE but works in close collaboration with donors to provide the support for the application of a PCE when requested. In all cases some counterpart resources should be considered and allocated at the na tional level to undertake planning, stakeholder identification and resource allocation for workshops to support and ensure that the PCE process is successfully completed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"11\">\r\n    Abbreviations and definitions\r\n</h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"Abbreviations\">\r\n    <a href=\"#Abbreviations\">Abbreviations and definitions</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n<div class=\"answer\">\r\n    <ul class=\"nobullets\">\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>APPPC</strong> - Asia and Pacific Plant Protection Commission\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CAN</strong> - Comunidad Andina\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CBD</strong> - Convention on Biological Diversity\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CDC</strong> - Capacity Development Committee\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CEPM</strong> - Committee of Experts on Phytosanitary Measures\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>COSAVE</strong> - Comite Regional de Sanidad Vegetal Para el Cono Sur\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CPM</strong> - Commission on Phytosanitary Measures\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>CPPC</strong> - Caribbean Plant Protection Commission\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>DP</strong> - Diagnostic Protocol\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>EPPO</strong> - European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ECCT</strong> - Expert Consultation on Cold Treatments\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ELISA</strong> - Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assey\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ePhyto</strong> - Electronic Phytosanitary Certification\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>EPPO</strong> - European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>EWG</strong> - Expert Working Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>FAO</strong> - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>GMO</strong> - Genetically Modified Organism\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>GRO</strong> - General Rules of the Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>GWG</strong> - Glossary Working Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IAEA</strong> - International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IAPSC</strong> - Inter-African Phytosanitary Council\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ICPM</strong> - Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IPP</strong> - International Phytosanitary Portal (the www.ippc.int website)\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IPP-SG</strong> - IPP Support Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IPPC</strong> - International Plant Protection Convention\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IPPC-FC</strong> - Finance Committee\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IRSS</strong> - Implementation Review &amp; Support System\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ISC</strong> - Interim Standards Committee\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ISO</strong> - International Standards Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>ISPM</strong> - International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>IWG</strong> - Interim Working Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>LMO</strong> - Living Modified Organism\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>LRG</strong> - Language Review Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NAPPO</strong> - North American Plant Protection Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NEPPO</strong> - Near East Plant Protection Organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NPPO</strong> - National plant protection organization\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NRO</strong> - National reporting obligation\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NROAG</strong> - National Reporting Obligations Advisory Group\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>NRT</strong> - New Revised Text (of the International Plant Protection Convention)\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>OCS</strong> - Online Comments System\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>OIE</strong> - Office International des ?
