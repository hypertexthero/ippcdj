# Todo Now:

- In sidebar only list pages that are in current section
- Restricted Work Area
    - Permalink for individual publications
    - [Restricted area working group pages and working group view/add permissions](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/content-architecture.html#page-permissions). **Look up Alex Martelli's example from EuroPython for one possible way to do this elegantly.** Looks like we need a [can_view](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/UJsHUtv8FUg) permission to be used with [django-guardian](https://github.com/lukaszb/django-guardian).
    - [Create can_view permission](http://andrewingram.net/2012/dec/common-pitfalls-django-south/): `python manage.py syncdb --all`
        - In sidebar list pages accessible to each user [according to permissions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16016717), and only display page content if user is in the page's permission group.
            - Permissions groups: 
                - Anonymous User - AUTO
                - Logged In User - AUTO
                - Administrator - AUTO

# Todo Future:

- Use jQuery [multi-file-upload](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload) functionality for uploading files [with additional fields for each file](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data).
