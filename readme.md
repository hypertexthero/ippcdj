# Better content management system for IPPC

Based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org).

Here's [some documentation to get started](https://github.com/hypertexthero/ippcdj/blob/master/docs/documentation.md).

## Things to do

- [Email utility](https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer)
    - Ability to insert user groups as well as individual users in `To:` field in `/admin/mailer/message/add/`
        - Use [admin actions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/actions/)?
        - [Custom admin form](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6099360/412329) overriding mailer's default form? Also see [this](http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1650/) and [this](https://gist.github.com/luzfcb/1712348)
        - Custom email utility app and admin form calling django-mailer and groups?
- Ability to authenticate against external user database
    - [Identity Authentication on the Internet](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/08/identity-internet/)
    - [Drupal 7 password hasher for Django](http://stackoverflow.com/q/9876700/412329)
- [Pest Report mapping](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html)
    - <http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2008/04/thematic-mapping-with-geojson.html>
    - <http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2012/11/how-to-minify-geojson-files.html>
    - Examples:
        - [Geochart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart)

        - [Top Cities](http://techslides.com/leaflet-map-with-utfgrid-and-php-served-mbtiles/)
- Homepage design
    - Â¿'Add Pest Report' button in countries for NPPOs, visible even when user is logged out. Once user logs in, if they're an NPPO, they are redirected to the pest report form for their country?
- [Calendar](https://github.com/shurik/mezzanine.calendar) (or [Events](https://github.com/stbarnabas/mezzanine-events)?)
- Account registration & [activation](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/user-accounts.html#account-approval) system?
- Forums
- Contact form
- FAQ
- Sitemap
- Author field for publications
- Versioning of all page content?
- Country pages:
    - Versioning of Pest Reports. Report number: GBR-32/1. When edited: GBR-32/2.
    - Other country forms
    - Prevent hidden report titles from appearing in search results
    - Country RSS feeds
- Last modified date for pages
- Use jQuery [multi-file-upload](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload) functionality for uploading images and files to be inserted in pages and blog posts, [with additional fields for each file](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data) if required.
- [Download multiple files](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12951557/412329)
- Use [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) to make globalnav dropdowns friedly. Also in admin. There's a [Django app](https://github.com/theatlantic/django-chosen), too.
- Order permission groups alphabetically in admin
- User registration open but behind login-required and super-user required so only admins can add new users, who get notification emails to confirm account and set own password. OR, user registration open to all, but need approval by admins.
